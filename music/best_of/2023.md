This was a tough year. I'm not going to get into the details on a webpage that anyone on the
Internet can find, but I had less time to listen to music than in the past, and that's reflected
in the smaller number of albums that I was able to review. There is still great stuff here, though!
I hope that you're able to find something you like.
