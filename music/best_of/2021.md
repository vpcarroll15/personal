This year, I listened to lots of metal. Again. No surprise there, I guess.

But I also began branching out in some different directions. I tried some artsy electronic music:
*Magic Oneohtrix Point Never* and *Rossz Csillag Alatt Sz√ºletett* were two of my favorite albums from this
year. I listened to some video game soundtracks and some musicals. And I tried listening to some older albums,
like *The Mantle*, to better my understanding of the greatest hits.

I'd like to continue to branch out in 2022, if I can find the time. I have a feeling that it will be a very busy year...
