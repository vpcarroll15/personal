This year, I listened to lots of metal. Again. No surprise there, I guess.

But I also began branching out in some different directions. I tried some artsy electronic music:
[_Magic Oneohtrix Point Never_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/135) and
[_Rossz Csillag Alatt Született_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/139) were two of my
favorites. I listened to some video game soundtracks and some musicals. And I tried listening to
some older albums, like [_The Mantle_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/142), to better my
understanding of the greatest hits.

I'd like to continue to branch out in 2022, if I can find the time. I have a feeling that it will be
a very busy year...
