Last year I thought I was on the verge of branching out in my musical taste. Honestly, I did not. I
found myself thinking about things other than music this year: my wedding, most importantly, but
also the book that I'm working on. And my job, of course.

Still, I found some good stuff this year, and I'm happy to share it.
