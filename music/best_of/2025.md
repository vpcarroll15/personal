I've hardly listened to music since Wallace was born, so this
list is going to be shorter than usual, and we'll see if next
year has a list at all! I'm still rebuilding my life post-baby. One day I'll
share some of this music with him, and he won't want to listen
to it. I'm looking forward to trying anyway!
