Music is important to me to help navigate and commemorate transitions. This year, I had plenty:
switching jobs, moving in with my girlfriend, and, of course, the madness of the coronavirus crisis.
For that reason, I think that I will remember several of these albums for a long time.

Let's hope for equally good music and less drama in 2021.
