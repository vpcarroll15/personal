Depressing screechy metal.

Reminds me a bit of Deafheaven, but darker. A better comparison might be Zao, but less
complicated, more shoegazey.

I'm not sure why this one worked so well for me, but I was jamming out to it at work.
I like the slow pace, the dissonances. I love how the vocalist sings "crush my skull" on
"Summer Comes to Multiply."

The album had a similar effect on me as what I get from slowcore. It's relaxing, even
though the vocalist is shrieking like he's in peril.
