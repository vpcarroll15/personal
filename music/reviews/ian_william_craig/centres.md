Ambient electronic. Centres was released in 2016; Slow Vessels was a follow-up in 2017 which stripped down some of the songs on Centres to their cores. An extraordinary pair of albums. Craig’s voice struggles against or is uplifted by tumults of static, piano, and electronic dissonance. Try “Contain - Astoria Version” or “The Nearness.”
