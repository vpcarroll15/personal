Albums usually start get off to a good start and then fade. This one tilts in the
opposite direction.

I found the first few tracks to be mildly boring or irritating. "Vibrations on
a String" is fine, but "Forwardism" is a weird electronic Prussian march,
and "Melodica" is dull ambient music, made by someone who may not understand
ambient music well.

Once we arrive at "Articulation," though, I started to enjoy the album a lot more. It
reminded me of "Forwardism" but without the bombastic excessiveness that I had found so
difficult to listen to. "Still Here" is the kind of wide-eyed dreamy electronic track
that I can never get enough of. I like the peaceful, simple finish.

As for the album's closer, "Sudden Awareness of Now"...this is the kind of epic,
soaring, syncopated ballad that made me confident that I would have to write about
this album on my website. I think almost everyone would enjoy it.

If you like electronic, spacey stuff, try the second half of this one.
