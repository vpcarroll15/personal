Straightforward metal that is heavily influenced by the sound of the 1980's. Big, simple riffs.
Kinda thrashy. Music like this lives or dies on how catchy it is, and this is catchy, thank
goodness. The first four tracks, in particular, are a ton of fun.

The vocals are fine but leave a little bit to be desired. The main vocalist enunciates well but
lacks gutteral power. This is how I suspect that I would sound if I had to front a metal band.
Fortunately, the vocals are layered beneath the guitars, which have a great, crisp sound. I also
love the tight coordination between the guitars and the drums.

Check out the first half of this album. I feel confident that you'll have a good time.
