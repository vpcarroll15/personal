This album makes me wonder...what makes a piece of music interesting? Here, we have some light
synths, some circular melodies, washed out and fuzzy. There are so many bad, boring albums like
this. And yet _Still Innocence_ held my attention all the way through.

Like a lot of simple ambient music, _Still Innocence_'s Bandcamp comes with startling claims about
this music's ability to improve our lives: "Let _Still Innocence_ serve as your spiritual guide as
you unburden yourselves of the shackles of these difficult times, to reconnect with your true self,
replete with curiosity and unpolluted by the cynicism that has built up over years of being exposed
to countless horrors." I would classify the album as a pleasant listen.

It reminds me a bit of Eldamar, one of my favorite artists from 2019. The difference is that
Eldamar's music makes a wonderful contrast between the ugly and the beautiful, whereas Lustre is
unrelentingly beautiful. Sometimes the band does something strange, like playing the sound of a baby
crying over "Nestle Within," but the element that would elevate this music to the next level is a
mastery of dissonance.

One final word on the baby sounds in "Nestle Within"...when I first heard them, I was like, "What on
earth were they thinking?" But now, bizarrely, they've kind of grown on me. Music is weird.
