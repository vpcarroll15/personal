This album makes me wonder...what makes a piece of music interesting? Here, we have some light synths, some circular
melodies, washed out and fuzzy. There are so many bad, boring albums like this. And yet *Still Innocence* held my
attention all the way through.

Like a lot of simple ambient music, *Still Innocence*'s Bandcamp comes with startling claims about this music's
ability to improve our lives: "Let *Still Innocence* serve as your spiritual guide as you unburden yourselves of the
shackles of these difficult times, to reconnect with your true self, replete with curiosity and unpolluted by the
cynicism that has built up over years of being exposed to countless horrors." I would classify the album as a pleasant listen.

It reminds me a bit of Eldamar, one of my favorite artists from 2019. The difference is that Eldamar's music
makes a wonderful contrast between the ugly and the beautiful, whereas Lustre is unrelentingly beautiful. Sometimes
the band does something strange, like playing the sound of a baby crying over "Nestle Within," but the element
that would elevate this music to the next level is a mastery of dissonance.

One final word on the baby sounds in "Nestle Within"...when I first heard them, I was like, "What on earth were they
thinking?" But now, bizarrely, they've kind of grown on me. Music is weird.
