I like to think that I don't like gimmicky bands, but Finntroll--a group of Finnish guys
who have been dressing up as trolls and rocking out since 1997--has caused me to
reconsider that.

To be fair, isn't all metal music a bit gimmicky? The ridiculous costumes, the stylized
brooding...is anyone actually like that in real life? There's an aesthetic here that
makes no sense in any other context except Halloween.

Still, dressing up as a troll feels next-level to me, and I was not prepared to like
Finntroll's latest album. I was pleasantly surprised. This is not especially thought-
provoking or complex music. By the standards of black metal, it's easy
listening. But the riffs are there, and many of the songs are catchy. I've been
spinning this album for days, and I've been surprised by how well it has stuck with me.

The voice here is usually understated, and the most important
elements are the guitars and the synth. The synth! I wish that more metal
bands used synth like this, to provide marvelous energy and make their music
almost danceable. "Stjärnors Mjöd" might be dull
were it not for the triumphant dance synth in the bridge. Same with "Vid Häxans Härd,"
which punches up its chorus with some great synth work. The guitar and the crisp
pauses in "Grenars Väg" add polish to a classic folk metal track. "Att Döda Med En Sten"
leaves plenty of room for the vocals--I love the long extended screams
buttressed by the guitar.

Not all the tracks are winners. The intro track is dull, and the last few tracks
also sag for me. I think Finntroll excels when they are frenetic, and the more
linear tracks don't feel that interesting. To be fair, I also don't understand
the lyrics, so perhaps some interesting verbal things are going on.

A really solid and fun album.
