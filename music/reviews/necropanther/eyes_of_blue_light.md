Melodic death metal from my hometown of Denver, Colorado. (!) Short, trashy tracks that strike
quickly.

I'm not sure why this album didn't grab me more than it did. I only remember a few of the tracks,
which is why I can't award a score higher than 1. But the tracks that I liked were exceptional.
"Hunter Seeker" is one of the most exciting things I've heard this year. The chorus is a series of
wonderfully evocative trochees: "Hunter-seeker, / Poison feeder, / Death receiver, / Hidden master,
/ Silent laughter, / Holtzmann dancer, / Your disaster." This was great motivation as I drove to
interviews!

Perhaps the issue was that the tracks are too homogenous for me? Same instruments, similar tempos,
similar themes. I'm reminded of an album like
[_Nightmare Logic,_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/62) which had a similar ultra-heavy
homogenous style. Yes, these albums are badass, but the lack of variety makes listening to the
entire album a chore.

Another, quite plausible theory is that I am burned out on metal at the moment and need to listen to
some different stuff. That would be OK too. :)
