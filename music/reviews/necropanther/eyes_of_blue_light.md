Melodic death metal from my hometown of Denver, Colorado. (!) Short, trashy tracks
that strike quickly.

I'm not sure why this album didn't grab me more than it did. I only remember a few of the
tracks, which is why I can't award a score higher than 1. But the tracks that I liked
were exceptional. "Hunter Seeker" is one of the most exciting things I've heard this year.
The chorus is a series of wonderfully evocative trochees: "Hunter-seeker, / Poison feeder, /
Death receiver, / Hidden master, / Silent laughter, / Holtzmann dancer, / Your disaster."
This was great motivation as I drove to interviews!

Perhaps the issue was that the tracks are too homogenous for me? Same instruments, similar tempos,
similar themes. I'm reminded of an album like [*Nightmare Logic,*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/62)
which had a similar ultra-heavy homogenous style. Yes, these albums are badass, but the lack of
variety makes listening to the entire album a chore.

Another, quite plausible theory is that I am burned out on metal at the moment and need to
listen to some different stuff. That would be OK too. :)
