An album that is two hours long is inevitably going to have some
flab, and I wouldn't say that every track thrilled me. In fact,
many of the tracks took some time to grow on me; I found them a
bit dull at first.

The album would be
better if the beginning and end of each track were trimmed down
by a minute. They're painfully slow to get going. I'm guessing
that this is useful if you're deejaying a show, but for someone
just listening to the album, it's less nice.

Still, the album convinced me in the end. The "cores"
of the tracks are very good: not quite as spacey as [*Powers of Ten*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/15), smoother and more
organic-sounding, which seems to be a progression that many
electronic artists make. It's good music to work to, and I
recommend it.
