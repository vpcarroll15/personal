An album that is two hours long is inevitably going to have some flab, and I wouldn't say that every
track thrilled me. In fact, many of the tracks took some time to grow on me; I found them a bit dull
at first.

The album would be better if the beginning and end of each track were trimmed down by a minute.
They're painfully slow to get going. I'm guessing that this is useful if you're deejaying a show,
but for someone just listening to the album, it's less nice.

Still, the album convinced me in the end. The "cores" of the tracks are very good: not quite as
spacey as [_Powers of Ten_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/15), smoother and more
organic-sounding, which seems to be a progression that many electronic artists make. It's good music
to work to, and I recommend it.
