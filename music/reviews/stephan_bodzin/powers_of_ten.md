Impeccably executed, if rather conventional techno. Some of the tracks are wonderfully kinetic and have stuck in my mind for days, with great rhythms and syncopation. I also love how the low end of this album rumbles. Put it on in the car, crank up the volume, and your windows will tremble. Listening to this album feels a bit like taking a journey through deep space, looking out at supernovas.

The tracks are long, averaging about eight minutes. Bodzin is capable of finding a nice groove and sitting in it while he sets something up. Nothing on the album feels rushed or schizophrenic.

My only complaint about the album is that it feels a bit too professional and a bit too smooth. It’s difficult to feel affectionate about it--easier to admire it. I have a hunch that this is a flaw in the art. Still, a great album to listen to if you want to get some work done or drive somewhere in style.

Best tracks: “Zulu,” “Wir,” “Birth”
