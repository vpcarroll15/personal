Rock/folk. Great album about the pain of a broken relationship. Female vocals, piano, guitar. Simple stuff but the lyrics and the delivery are terrific. Also, I think that this is the first album that Iâ€™ve ever liked by someone younger than I am...yikes. I would start at the beginning of this one.
