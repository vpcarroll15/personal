Somehow I've reached a point in my life where doom music is comforting. I found this album
effortlessly listenable and relaxing, even though the main vocalist sounds like demon spawn.

_The Storm Within_ is great doom. It has some spoken-word sections that I don't like, and
atmospheric tracks like "Even Tide" are boring, but when the band is making music, it works. "The
Calling" (which I think is the single?) has a simple melody and opening that allows the vocalist to
really get rumbling, and I love the moody, swirling bridge. The two long tracks that open the album
are also strong--straightforward but stark.

Perhaps the album is relaxing because it's so patient and simple. Don't expect technical riffs or
intricate rhythms or quick tempos. There's enough going on to keep it interesting, but the clutter
has been stripped out.
