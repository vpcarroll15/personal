Somehow I've reached a point in my life where doom music is comforting. I found this album
effortlessly listenable and relaxing, even though the main vocalist sounds like
demon spawn.

*The Storm Within* is great doom. It has some spoken-word sections that I don't like, and
atmospheric tracks like "Even Tide" are boring, but when the band is making music,
it works. "The Calling" (which I think is the single?) has a simple melody and opening
that allows the vocalist to really get rumbling, and I love the moody, swirling bridge.
The two long tracks that open the album are also strong--straightforward
but stark.

Perhaps the album is relaxing because it's so patient and simple. Don't expect technical riffs
or intricate rhythms or quick tempos. There's enough going on to keep it interesting, but
the clutter has been stripped out.
