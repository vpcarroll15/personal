Doom metal.

I can imagine bumping up the score of this one once I've listened to it some
more. "Christ Alive" is an outrageously good track, instantly memorable and with
powerful doom vocals. Not many other tracks have made an impression in early
listening. I just don't find this band's atmospheric stuff compelling, and spoken
word stuff is a bit tedious. But I have to include this for "Christ Alive."
