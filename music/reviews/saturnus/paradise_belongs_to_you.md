Doom metal.

I can imagine bumping up the score of this one once I've listened to it some more. "Christ Alive" is
an outrageously good track, instantly memorable and with powerful doom vocals. Not many other tracks
have made an impression in early listening. I just don't find this band's atmospheric stuff
compelling, and spoken word stuff is a bit tedious. But I have to include this for "Christ Alive."
