Here's a fun fact: if you name your album *Currents*, do not be surprised if you struggle to be one of the top five
albums on Spotify named *Currents.* Seriously, because of the title, this album is not easy to find. Search by artist
and you will do better.

This album is more technical than I normally like. Listen to the beginning of the first track, "Seekers of the Truth,"
and you will know what I mean. It's rhythmically complex and restlessly introduces new ideas. Often, albums
of which this is true are a big mess; but *Currents* captures my attention and has a lovely energy. The transition at
3:15 in "Seekers of the Truth" is an example of something technical that works for me. Rather than linger on a
slow-paced, meandering section, In Vain does a fancy quick transition back to their primary theme, and I applaud the
band for not wasting my time.

In my favorite track, "And Quiet Flows the Scheldt," the melody is more straightforward, and the vocalist is given a
chance to really dig into his growl. I love the section around 3:40. Another great track, "Blood We Shed," captures a
sense of high drama. I don't think that it 100% works...it feels rushed to me and over the top, and the structure
isn't as natural as what I admire in "And Quiet Flows the Scheldt." But I can forgive a track a lot of minor flaws
if it has lovely choir vocals.

All in all, I was close between a 1 and a 2. I settled on a 1 because the back half of the album wasn't as interesting
to me, but this is definitely worth a listen.
