Heavy, progressive melodeath. I love that it has kickass melodies but also this
progressive element that keeps it unpredictable.

This trick has worked on me in so many albums, but In Vain does a great job of
interspersing faster, gruffer sections in the "metal voice" with
slower countermelodies that have "clean vocals." They also mix in ambient or jazzy
sections with a saxophone. Ambient stuff is so poorly done on most metal albums,
but here it's not too long and feels right.

"Blood Makes the Grass Grow" might be my favorite, just for the straightforward
brutality of the chorus, but at least half of the tracks got my attention.
