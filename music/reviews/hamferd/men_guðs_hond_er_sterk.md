Doom metal.

Quieter than their previous excellent albums. Similar in style, but the volume is turned
down--everything is subtler. I miss the drama of their earlier work, but the quality of execution is
extremely high. When they reach an emotional climax, like in the opening track or in "Í hamferð,"
it's compelling.

So many albums try to sound like this and just end up bad. Hamferð is so beautiful within the slow
tempo, and the complex rhythms hold attention.
