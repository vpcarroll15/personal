I am not going to write much about this album, because I already wrote so much about its sibling [*Tamsins
Iikam*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/96), but this thing is absolutely terrific if you want something
heavy. I would consider giving it another "3," but I like the first half quite a bit more than the back half, so a
2 seems correct.

But wow, that first half! This is bleak, oppressive, beautiful stuff. Try figuring out the time signatures at
the beginning of "Evst" if you want a fun rhythm challenge. In "Deydir vardar" and "Vid teimum kvirru grau," the guitars
sound exhausted in a way that grabs the heart. The vocal performances are also top-touch, and most of the time the
singer isn't even growling. (Although I love it when he does...)

There are certain bands that showcase impressive dramatic range, and there are other bands that absolutely nail a
certain kind of sound. Hamferd belongs to the second group. If you like that sound, there is even more to swim in here.
