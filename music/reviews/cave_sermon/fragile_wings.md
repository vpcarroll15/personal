Death metal/post rock/prog crossover with jangly guitars.

There's something a bit lo-fi about it, or honky-tonk, but it's not either
of those things. The vocals are pretty traditional death metal. It has the
felicitous transitions and flow of a good prog album, but it's tighter than
prog usually is, quicker to transition to something new.

Whatever this is, Cave Sermon is in total control of his sound. This feels like
the work of an assured, confident artist. It was close to a 3 for me for that
reason; I was in the palm of his hand. Daring music that is easy to listen to.
Great stuff.
