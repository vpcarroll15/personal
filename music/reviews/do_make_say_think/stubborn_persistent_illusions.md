I was starting to wonder if I didn’t actually like post-rock. So much of it puts me in a
torpor...the kind of feeling which one gets after Thanksgiving dinner. Thank goodness I came across
this album. This is post-rock which finally breaks free of the model set by Explosions in the Sky
and does something a bit different. It’s not just atmosphere: it has real emotion, and some
surprisingly technical drum play.

“Horripilation” is a particularly interesting track. The layers which they start building in the
second minute, dissolving into air in the fourth minute, are an astonishing setpiece, and the drums
do a tremendous amount of work holding everything together.
