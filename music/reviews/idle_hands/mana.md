Classic 80's style heavy rock.

Propulsive three-minute songs make this album a pleasure to listen to. Lots of good hooks and great
energy. The male vocalist articulates clearly and his voice has an interesting timbre.

I didn't find this album an emotional experience, and honestly, listening to it straight through, I felt
that it became a little monotonous. There isn't sufficient variety in tempos or textures. Nevertheless, I liked sampling
individual songs. "Nightfall" and "Cosmic Overdrive" have wonderful push, and "Dragon, Why Do You Cry?" stands out for
its interesting melody, although the repeated invocation of the word "dragon" is so cheesy that it took me out of the
moment.

Listen to this for the well-crafted songs, the striking male voice, and the propulsive energy.
