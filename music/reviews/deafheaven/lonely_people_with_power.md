What a terrific blend of metal and shoegaze.

I've been a Deafheaven fan since *Sunbather* but haven't paid attention to them
in the past few years. I missed *Infinite Granite,* which I should circle
back to at some point. But this album nails the essence of what I think Deafheaven can be:
an overwhelmingly pretty blend of black metal and shoegaze.

The vocalist has always been a strength. He has a searing hawk-like cry. But this album
mixes in clean vocals on tracks like "Heathen": the soft dreamy vocals of shoegaze
or post-rock. Why aren't these genres mixed more often? Deafheaven makes it sound
effortless.

*Lonely People with Power* oozes mastery in small details, which gives it the feeling
of a "great" or "important" album. I'll always fondly remember *Sunbather,* but the band's sound
is more mature now and I think more interesting.
