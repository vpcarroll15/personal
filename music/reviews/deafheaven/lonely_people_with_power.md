What a terrific blend of metal and shoegaze.

I've been a Deafheaven fan since _Sunbather_ but haven't paid attention to them in the past few
years. I missed _Infinite Granite,_ which I should circle back to at some point. But this album
nails the essence of what I think Deafheaven can be: an overwhelmingly pretty blend of black metal
and shoegaze.

The vocalist has always been a strength. He has a searing hawk-like cry. But this album mixes in
clean vocals on tracks like "Heathen": the soft dreamy vocals of shoegaze or post-rock. Why aren't
these genres mixed more often? Deafheaven makes it sound effortless.

_Lonely People with Power_ oozes mastery in small details, which gives it the feeling of a "great"
or "important" album. I'll always fondly remember _Sunbather,_ but the band's sound is more mature
now and I think more interesting.
