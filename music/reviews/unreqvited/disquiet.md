Sometimes you want to listen to a great album, and sometimes you just want to listen to dramatic
rock music with a guy shrieking on top. If that's where you are right now in your life, then this
album is for you.

That's being a little cruel. I take genuine pleasure in this album. But there is something about the
structure that is almost bafflingly simple. The band plays a heartfelt melody, usually highly
repetitive, and the singer shrieks on top. That really is it. I don't have much more to say about
it.

The best tracks are probably "Disquiet" and "Maydena." "The Autumn Fire" is good too.
