Sometimes you want to listen to a great album, and sometimes you just want to listen to dramatic rock music with a
guy shrieking on top. If that's where you are right now in your life, then this album is for you.

That's being a little cruel. I take genuine pleasure in this album. But there is something about the structure that is
almost bafflingly simple. The band plays a heartfelt melody, usually highly repetitive, and the singer shrieks
on top. That really is it. I don't have much more to say about it.

The best tracks are probably "Disquiet" and "Maydena." "The Autumn Fire" is good too.
