Brainy black metal. Great syncopated rhythms, especially on my favorite track, _The Promethean
Spark._ Grand orchestral backdrops: I love the contrast between violins and the shrieking black
metal voice. Speaking of which, the vocals are good but not really notable. Reminds me of _Thy
Catafalque_ in its iconoclasm, but the last few tracks are a little flabby/uninteresting.
