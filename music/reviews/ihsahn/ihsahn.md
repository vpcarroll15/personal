Brainy black metal. Great syncopated rhythms, especially on my favorite track,
*The Promethean Spark.* Grand orchestral backdrops: I love the contrast
between violins and the shrieking black metal voice. Speaking of which, the vocals are
good but not really notable. Reminds me of *Thy Catafalque* in its iconoclasm, but the
last few tracks are a little flabby/uninteresting.
