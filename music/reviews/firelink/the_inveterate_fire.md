Some black metal albums have crunchy hooks and tight songs. _The Inveterate Fire_ feels more like
jazz. The tracks are long and unfold over several sequential melodies or themes.

There are advantages to this style. It can feel organic, and I find that albums like this hold up
well to repeated listens. But there is one unfortunate side effect, which is that individual tracks
aren't so memorable. A track feels like a meander through a park, rather than a blast of genius. I
remember bits of each of the tracks, but the tracks as a whole are hard to visualize.

Unsurprisingly, _The Inveterate Fire_ took a while to grow on me. At first, it felt like a formless
mess. But there are moments of inspiration that, even on first listen, surprised me. I love
everything from 6:20 to 8:30 on "Kindled," or the quiet opening to "Beckoning Sun." The end of
"Beckoning Sun" reminds me of Deafheaven--the part of Deafheaven I like. It nails the weird mix of
shoegaze and black metal.

This album is too formless and meandering to get the highest possible rating from me, but I think it
conjured a compelling atmosphere, and had lots of moments that captured my attention.
