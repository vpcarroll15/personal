I have said this before, but the surest sign that an album should get a 3/3 from me is that
it occupies a unique place in sonic space: it isn't beholden to a particular
genre or style, and it isn't a faint echo of another, greater artist. *Vadak* really
sounds like nothing else. It's weird at the beginning, and becomes weirder as it goes on. But
unlike much weird music, it's catchy and engaging in surprising ways.

I knew that I was listening to something special when the bagpipes came in at 0:30
of the second track, "Köszöntsd a hajnalt," followed by an
absorbing musical soundscape. The abrasiveness and weirdness of the bagpipes fused
traditional folk music with black metal in a way that commanded my attention.

Of course, fusing folk music with black metal isn't novel. Half of black metal
bands have a pretense of folkishness, and many of them dress in folk
costumes. But here, for some reason, it really works.

The album contained other, more surprising genre fusions, especially in its second
half. "A kupolaváros titka" can only be described as jazzy, with its 7/8 time signature and
light touch on the cymbals. "Piros-sárga" is breathtakingly psychedlic: the metal influences
are difficult to even find. Thy Catafalque has a deft touch with the synthesizer.

My favorite track, "Vadak (Az átváltozás rítusai)," is a perfect folk/black metal synthesis.
After a rollicking guitar opening that, truth be told, I would have trimmed from the final
edit of the song, the band lays down a melody on the cello that could be the
accompaniment to two medieval warloads fighting a duel to the death. This music is so badass.
When the fantasy/folk music needs to be kicked to the next level, the vocalist crashes in
with some anguished screaming.

I learned after listening to this album that Thy Catafalque is a one-man band, which kind
of makes sense, because the album has a lot of eccentricities. Just like *The Lord of the Rings*
has meandering passages that would have been edited out if the trilogy had been composed by several
writers, so *Vadak* has some pacing and structure issues. Fifteen minutes of the album's
runtime could have been trimmed out. The flat male and female voices speaking on top of the
tracks contribute little. But the eccentricities of this album made a track like
"Vadak (Az átváltozás rítusai)" possible, so really I feel like I have nothing to complain about.

Try this and be patient if all you can see at first are the warts.
