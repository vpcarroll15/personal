A brilliant album that I think someone different than me would enjoy tremendously. I was
only able to enjoy it halfway.

*Gloire Ã‰ternelle* is technical death metal, emphasis on technical. There is so much
stuff stuffed in here; it's bursting at the seams with guitar riffs, spicy flamenco music, and
frantic growly vocals. It's a complete mess, but I think that it is difficult to listen to this
album and not come to the conclusion that it is kind of a brilliant mess. Occasionally I catch
a glimpse of how some of the pieces fit together, and I'm exhilarated. But just as often I'm
lost, and when I get lost I get bored.

I probably wouldn't have bothered to review the album at all if it weren't for the flamenco
sections, so I should talk about that a bit more. Juxtaposing technical metal music
with technical dance music is such a brilliant idea that I'm surprised that I haven't
stumbled across it more often. Of course, it must be difficult to execute well.

I respect this album, but I can't say that I am fond of it. Still, a mind-expanding listen.
