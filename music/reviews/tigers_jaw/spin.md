Not a mind-blowing album, but a solid, pleasant-sounding release from a veteran rock/emo band. A good album for when you’re driving in the car and feeling a bit nostalgic. I wish that it had a bit more bite or intensity--for a band often classified as pop punk, there isn’t much punk to speak of--but I still enjoyed listening to this.
