One special thing that a good album can do is to awaken me to the beauty
of a particular instrument. *Abysses* accomplishes that for the clarinet.
Before listening to this, I'm not sure that I could've identified
a clarinet from a lineup of wind instruments; now I would feel more confident.

Interestingly, I don't think the clarinet is supposed to be the centerpiece.
This is neoclassical or neofolk music, mostly based on the guitar and with some
light drumming. Sometimes there are vocals, either black metal style or the
ethereal processed vocals that I am also partial to. The clarinet is meant
to be an accent, in the same way that the vocals are; but for me, it steals
the show. The vocals are nothing extraordinary, but the clarinet stands
out.

Try "Sentiero dell'eternita" for an example of what I mean. The band's core set of
instruments establishes a nice melody, and then, just when it starts to get a little
repetitive, the clarinet slips in at 2:20 and lights it up. My other favorite track,
"Contemplation," features the clarinet throughout.

The end of the album takes a doomy, melancholy turn, which I think works well.
Neofolk music can get a bit saccharine, and I'm glad that the
creators of this album pushed back against that.

A better album would have pinned me to my seat a bit more, but *Abysses* is worth a listen
if you're into pretty, spare stuff, or if you want to hear some lovely clarinet.
