I've actually been listening to this album for a long time...I've hesitated in giving a review
because it's one of those tricky albums that my brain really likes, but my heart just feels ok
about.

Some of the tracks I can wholeheartedly recommend. II hits its beats hard and has wonderful plodding
heaviness. IV is just beautiful...a lot of musicians try to do interesting things with the human
breath but rarely as effectively as here. The melancholy tenor voice, the burning guitars, and the
breath catching in the throat. V is a difficult track--the voice is caustic even by death metal
standards--but the chorus has power. The entire album has high production value and moments of
exquisite taste. See the restrained intro to VIII for an example.

As a whole, though, the album is too damn slow and too damn monotonous. I like atmosphere and
repetition a lot, but when I see an album with twelve tracks labeled I through XII, I expect it to
tell a story, like chapters in a book. I have no idea what the story is here. I don't think that
there is one. Sonically, I think that things get a bit quieter and more reflective as the album goes
on, but I'm not sure.

I also want albums like this to present me with moments of genuine emotion. Death metal emotion is
stylized...a guy screeching into a microphone. That's fine--better than fine--but I think that every
album needs a moment when real, unaffected emotion breaks through, and I don't think that happens
here.

This was a tough album to review, but certainly a worthwhile listen.
