This album is apparently a throwback to an era of Swedish death metal that I was not alive for,
which maybe explains the muddy production? I assume that's a stylistic choice?

Anyway, the songs are a little samey, but there are some bangers. The album is tight and doesn't
overstay its welcome. I actually thought the slower songs like "Serrated Jaws" were a bit better:
the band can lean into its heavy sound, and the vocalist is quite good. I love the way that he says
"go for the killll." The faster songs might be better if the production were sharper, but I probably
don't know what I'm talking about.
