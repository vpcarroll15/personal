This album is apparently a throwback to an era of Swedish death
metal that I was not alive for, which maybe explains the muddy
production? I assume that's a stylistic choice?

Anyway, the songs are a little samey, but there are some bangers.
The album is tight and doesn't overstay its welcome. I
actually thought the slower songs like "Serrated Jaws" were a bit
better: the band can lean into its heavy sound, and the vocalist
is quite good. I love the way that he says "go for the killll."
The faster songs might be better if the production
were sharper, but I probably don't know what I'm talking about.
