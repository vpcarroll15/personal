Walking the line between technical/progressive metal and melodic death metal.

This album is too hectic and complex for me, but a few tracks stood out and I wanted
to make note of them. First the opener, "Forsaken." I just love listening to the bass
guitar, which goes on its own journey while everyone else is messing around in the
treble clef. Second, "Devoured Usurper," which has a delicious growling
chorus that reminds me of my favorite parts of
[*Come the Tide*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/93). Finally, "When Stars
Collide," which has a beautiful corkscrewing guitar solo.

I liked other parts of this album too, but I would be lying if I pretended that it held
together for me.
