Metal with a charismatic female vocalist. More vocals-focused than stuff
that I typically like. Kind of weird, too, with maybe an Eastern flair? The weirdness
kept me engaged the whole time. I've never heard anything quite like this.

"Wish" is an extraordinary track that I feel could have gone mainstream. Such a plaintive
chorus ("all I ever wanted to be was somebody's somebody's something...") with a punchy
countermelody. When the vocals become screechy on tracks like "I Will Break the
Pride of Your Heart," they're surprisingly guttural. Again the contrast between beautiful
and raw that I seem to love so much.
