At this point, I've listened to a lot of metal, so I'm thrilled when something passes through that
sounds like nothing I've heard before.

Anareta combines two kinds of albums that I've heard a lot of, but the synthesis feels brilliant and
like nothing I've heard before. On the one hand: moody post-metal post-classical string quartets. On
the other: screechy one-man-band black metal. The first group of albums is often pretty but can be
boring. The second group feels highly personal, but can be monotonous. It turns out that if you add
the structure of classical music to the screeching, you get a balance of complexity and emotion.

Of course, the execution also has to be on-point, and Anareta does a terrific job. All the tracks
are solid. I'm not sure that there are many standouts or ones that get stuck in your head, but like
much black metal, _Fear Not_ is more atmosphere than catchiness.

I appreciated the production. It sounds like folk music: not overprocessed. The contrast between the
vocals and the quartet is presented as though it just makes sense. Somehow they convinced me that it
does.
