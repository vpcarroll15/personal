Nobody else makes music like these guys. The weird classical/metal mix is
still interesting, and although I wasn't as captivating by this album as
I was by [*Griseus*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/164), I can still strongly recommend.

"Drama rising out of quietness" is what I wrote about *Griseus,* and that's
still the case here. Quiet instrumental sections, light classical,
swelling into something with a compelling rhythm or melody, then subsiding
back again. It feels dreamlike.

"Sombre Loom" almost works as a single if you want to sample just one thing.
It's all instrumental.
