This is probably the album that I have been most excited about this year.

Fair warning, it’s mellow and slow-paced. Many people will find it boring. That’s ok. For those of us
who like it, it’s very special.

Imagine an album that is truly half-classical and half-metal. Lots of metal albums have classical
flourishes…it’s common to hear some strings or brief classical accents in technical metal albums. But
Griseus is special because it assembles complete classical passages and refrains. You will sometimes forget
that you’re listening to metal at all. For long intervals, there won’t be screaming or drums or even
guitars…just eerie tapping of the piano that reminds me of Debussy.

And yes, there are metal parts too. It doesn’t have the crashing or searing heaviness of some albums, but
because it’s surrounded by classical ornamentation it makes an impact when it comes. Contrast is key.

My favorite track might be “In Lands of Ashes,” which starts with some light piano playing.
As it’s becoming a little dull, a folk dance springs to life—unexpected and delightful. *Griseus*
nails the surprising but earned transition. The track continues in the same pattern: quiet restrained
sections followed by serendipitous transitions to quicker melody.

Obviously I like this…hopefully you like it as much.
