This is probably the album that I have been most excited about this year.

Fair warning, it’s mellow and slow-paced. Many people will find it boring. That’s ok. For those of
us who like it, it’s very special.

Imagine an album that is truly half-classical and half-metal. Lots of metal albums have classical
flourishes…it’s common to hear some strings or brief classical accents in technical metal albums.
But Griseus is special because it assembles complete classical passages and refrains. You will
sometimes forget that you’re listening to metal at all. For long intervals, there won’t be screaming
or drums or even guitars…just eerie tapping of the piano that reminds me of Debussy.

And yes, there are metal parts too. It doesn’t have the crashing or searing heaviness of some
albums, but because it’s surrounded by classical ornamentation it makes an impact when it comes.
Contrast is key.

My favorite track might be “In Lands of Ashes,” which starts with some light piano playing. As it’s
becoming a little dull, a folk dance springs to life—unexpected and delightful. _Griseus_ nails the
surprising but earned transition. The track continues in the same pattern: quiet restrained sections
followed by serendipitous transitions to quicker melody.

Obviously I like this…hopefully you like it as much.
