An banger of a synth-metal album. This might be as good as synth-metal gets--at least I
don't think that I have heard anything better.

An all-instrumental one-man band, MASTER BOOT RECORD has been making these kinds of albums
for a long time, but this was the one first one that I listened to that connected
with me.

The first thing you will notice when listening to *PERSONAL COMPUTER* is that the
drums are a driving engine; the album has incredible momentum, like a soundtrack to
an action movie. Meanwhile, the arpeggiated synth quickly traces out a
melody. This reference
won't mean much to many people, but the album reminds me of the etudes that I used to
play on violin when I was a child: long sequences of sixteenth notes with only
occasional injections of notes of different lengths. This adds to the album's sense of
momentum and purpose.

Of course, it means little to say that a song is going somewhere if
the destination ends up being awful, but I think MASTER BOOT RECORD delivers here too.
The climaxes of the songs had a satisfying level of drama.

This album excels within its narrow niche of synth-metal crossover. I considered giving
it a 2 because the niche is so narrow and I am not convinced that this album does
anything novel or experimental, but I think a 3 is more representative of the quality.
There isn't a track on this album that I don't like. The slower ones have less momentum
and are a bit cheesier, but they compensate with some piercing climaxes. So I'm going
to stand by my high score.
