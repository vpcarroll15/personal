In theory this album is inspired by the discovery of an "Ice Fleet" of frozen ships off the coast of
Russia. In practice it's fairly conventional post-rock/post-metal that doesn't lean hard into the
concept album stuff. Which might be for the best! There is plenty to like here without too many
creaking, icy sound effects.

If you like spare black metal that edges on post-rock, this is a great fit for you. It's beautiful,
spare, restrained stuff. Start with the last two tracks: the transition from "Ote" to "Hauta" is
very nice, and the ghostly female vocals are breathtaking.

I don't think I can give this album a higher score because the middle is sparse in ideas and,
frankly, I became a bit bored. But I think that's a matter of taste, and someone who likes calmer
music should be able to sink deeply into this. The high points are high, and I am sure that I will
remember this album for a long time.
