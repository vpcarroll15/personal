(Note: this is a retro review of an album that I fell in love with years ago.)

Back in 2012, when I was a sophomore in college just starting to get into music, I stumbled across this album during
the Christmas holidays. My friend Thomas and I took a break from watching television to listen to this thing in his
basement. Pitchfork said that it was a masterpiece, like nothing we had ever heard before. Michael Gira, the band
leader, described his work as "trudging up a sand hill wearing a hair shirt, being sprayed with battery acid, with
a midget taunting you." Obviously, we needed to listen to it right away.

The track, "Lunacy," went ok. I thought that I understood what Pitchfork meant when it said that the album was intense.
"Lunacy" is definitely intense, but Thomas and I felt like we were doing well.
Then "Mother of the World" started. We shut the album off almost immediately. This music wasn't just intense--it was
ugly and brutal.

I came back to the album a month later, listening on my own this time. I still thought that it was ugly, but I was
also fascinated by the effect that it had on me. I continued to feel this way about Swans for a few weeks...the music
isn't good, it's just a gimmick that's been taken way too far.

What is the gimmick? Perhaps I should elaborate on that before I go any further. Lots of music is described as intense.
Death metal is intense. Punk is intense. Someone shrieking during a song in intense. This album spits on all those
lesser intensies. It's the nuclear blast dwarfing the fires made by cavemen. Instead of communicating its
intensity through primal displays of emotion, *The Seer* is tightly controlled. It doesn't show you that the people
performing the song are distraught; instead, it aims to make you distraught. It wants to hammer a needle into your
brain. Gira said that while making this album, he had grown tired of chord changes; so the songs
don't change chords. The energy is generated through rhythm: pounding, irregular, skittering beats.
I praise albums for patiently building to rich climaxes. *The Seer* is so damn patient that
it is two hours long. Just the title track is thirty-two minutes! (It also has an extended section where I think the
instrument is a chainsaw?)

Everything about this album is preposterously extreme. Do you remember how Gira describes his
own work? "Trudging up a sand hill wearing a hair shirt, being sprayed with battery acid, with a midget taunting you..."
This music is intense and epic, but it's also deranged. It doesn't really make intellectual sense.

So...is it good? Yeah, it's really good. It took me a while to come around, but when I did, I was hooked forever.
Parts of it are painful to listen to, but wow this album makes me feel alive. It taps into
something primal. Gira's song titles suggest that he was trying to create something epic: "Lunacy,"
"Mother of the World, "The Wolf," "The Seer"... What's miraculous is that he actually does it. It reminds me of John
Milton's ambition in writing *Paradise Lost*--to fly up to heaven, peek through the window, and bring his vision back
down to Earth. It's common to have grand ambitions, but highly unusual to fulfill them.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that *The Seer* offers occasional moments of catharsis. It's mostly
merciless, but not entirely. Some sections aren't disturbing at all--simply beautiful. "Avatar" is intense (of course),
but it's also heroic. The first ten minutes of "A Piece of the Sky" could have been taken from a top-notch ambient
album.

You should definitely try listening to this, but don't be surprised if you hate it at first. If you have a
strong emotional reaction, it's probably a good album for you.
