(Note: this is a retro review of an album that I fell in love with years ago.)

Back in 2012, when I was a sophomore in college just starting to get into music, I stumbled across
this album during the Christmas holidays. My friend Thomas and I took a break from watching
television to listen to this thing in his basement. Pitchfork said that it was a masterpiece, like
nothing we had ever heard before. Michael Gira, the band leader, described his work as "trudging up
a sand hill wearing a hair shirt, being sprayed with battery acid, with a midget taunting you."
Obviously, we needed to listen to it right away.

The track, "Lunacy," went ok. I thought that I understood what Pitchfork meant when it said that the
album was intense. "Lunacy" is definitely intense, but Thomas and I felt like we were doing well.
Then "Mother of the World" started. We shut the album off almost immediately. This music wasn't just
intense--it was ugly and brutal.

I came back to the album a month later, listening on my own this time. I still thought that it was
ugly, but I was also fascinated by the effect that it had on me. I continued to feel this way about
Swans for a few weeks...the music isn't good, it's just a gimmick that's been taken way too far.

What is the gimmick? Perhaps I should elaborate on that before I go any further. Lots of music is
described as intense. Death metal is intense. Punk is intense. Someone shrieking during a song in
intense. This album spits on all those lesser intensies. It's the nuclear blast dwarfing the fires
made by cavemen. Instead of communicating its intensity through primal displays of emotion, _The
Seer_ is tightly controlled. It doesn't show you that the people performing the song are distraught;
instead, it aims to make you distraught. It wants to hammer a needle into your brain. Gira said that
while making this album, he had grown tired of chord changes; so the songs don't change chords. The
energy is generated through rhythm: pounding, irregular, skittering beats. I praise albums for
patiently building to rich climaxes. _The Seer_ is so damn patient that it is two hours long. Just
the title track is thirty-two minutes! (It also has an extended section where I think the instrument
is a chainsaw?)

Everything about this album is preposterously extreme. Do you remember how Gira describes his own
work? "Trudging up a sand hill wearing a hair shirt, being sprayed with battery acid, with a midget
taunting you..." This music is intense and epic, but it's also deranged. It doesn't really make
intellectual sense.

So...is it good? Yeah, it's really good. It took me a while to come around, but when I did, I was
hooked forever. Parts of it are painful to listen to, but wow this album makes me feel alive. It
taps into something primal. Gira's song titles suggest that he was trying to create something epic:
"Lunacy," "Mother of the World, "The Wolf," "The Seer"... What's miraculous is that he actually does
it. It reminds me of John Milton's ambition in writing _Paradise Lost_--to fly up to heaven, peek
through the window, and bring his vision back down to Earth. It's common to have grand ambitions,
but highly unusual to fulfill them.

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that _The Seer_ offers occasional moments of catharsis. It's
mostly merciless, but not entirely. Some sections aren't disturbing at all--simply beautiful.
"Avatar" is intense (of course), but it's also heroic. The first ten minutes of "A Piece of the Sky"
could have been taken from a top-notch ambient album.

You should definitely try listening to this, but don't be surprised if you hate it at first. If you
have a strong emotional reaction, it's probably a good album for you.
