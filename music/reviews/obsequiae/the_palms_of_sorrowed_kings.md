It's a bit boring at times and didn't hold my interest all the way through, but I always have a soft
spot for medieval finger picking mixed with crystal clear rock guitars. The production value on this
thing is really good. The simple medieval transition tracks are perhaps my favorite ...they have a
lovely, lilting grace. The tracks themselves don't have much variety or dramatic tension, which is
why I can't give this album a stronger recommendation, but I am still glad that I found it.
