A spare ambient album that worked pretty well for me.
Can't give a higher recommendation because I don't think there
were any standout tracks or things that I couldn't stop listening
to, but I was engaged all the way through. Understated, but with
moments of structure and warmth.

All the tracks are named after colors, and although I think the
names could be randomly reassigned and nobody would be the wiser,
I appreciate that "magenta" gets an ominous,
grinding track. Who likes magenta?
