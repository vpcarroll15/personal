A spare ambient album that worked pretty well for me. Can't give a higher recommendation because I
don't think there were any standout tracks or things that I couldn't stop listening to, but I was
engaged all the way through. Understated, but with moments of structure and warmth.

All the tracks are named after colors, and although I think the names could be randomly reassigned
and nobody would be the wiser, I appreciate that "magenta" gets an ominous, grinding track. Who
likes magenta?
