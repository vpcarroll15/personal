Progressive melodic death metal from Denmark.

The album cover says it all, really. This is ambitious, densely layered stuff. The tracks are long
and flesh out their themes thoroughly. Some of them could be trimmed a bit, but I never got the
sense that these guys were wasting my time. The guitars and drums lay down a driving beat that makes
it effortless to stay engaged.

Like in all good progressive music, each track has moments of fluidity and serendipity that make me
excited or capture my imagination. The density of those moments wasn't high enough for this album to
earn my highest possible score, but they were excellent when they came. The last two minutes of
"Waves Below" and the climaxes of the first two tracks are standouts.
