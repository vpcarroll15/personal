Progressive melodic death metal from Denmark.

The album cover says it all, really. This is ambitious, densely layered stuff. The tracks are long and flesh
out their themes thoroughly. Some of them could be trimmed a bit, but I never got the sense that these guys were
wasting my time. The guitars and drums lay down a driving beat that makes it effortless to stay engaged.

Like in all good progressive music, each track has moments of fluidity and serendipity that make me excited or
capture my imagination. The density of those moments wasn't high enough for this album to earn my highest
possible score, but they were excellent when they came. The last two minutes of "Waves Below" and the climaxes
of the first two tracks are standouts.
