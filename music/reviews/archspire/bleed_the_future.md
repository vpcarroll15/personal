I don't like technical death metal. I find it boring, alienating, and kinda
weird. So I'm a little surprised to find that I am writing about *Bleed the Future.*

I started listening to it almost as a joke. I had heard that this album was so extreme
and technical that it pushed the limits of what death metal could be. When I first gave
it a spin, it reminded me of Dethklok, the fictional band from the animated
series *Metalocalypse.* The styling was so over the top, and the lyrics were so silly. The
chorus of the opening track is the words "drone corpse aviator."
I chuckled, put the album away, and didn't expect to come back to it.

I came back to it. After listening to it a couple dozen more times... I
have to admit, it's pretty good. If I were a fan of technical death metal, this
might be my favorite album of all time. The riffs are searing and extraordinary. The
vocalist's growl is so stylized that I can't take it seriously but it certainly
builds the immersive, apocalyptic atmosphere.

There are melodies to appreciate here, even if they are
buried beneath the spectacular show. The contrast between quiet and loud moments on
"Bleed the Future" is really thought-provoking. The slower tracks had a bit more
melody and structure, which is why I liked them a bit more: the chord progression
in the second half of "Reverie on the Onyx" feels classical.

I didn't feel a whole lot of emotion while listening to *Bleed the Future* except
perhaps awe that such a perfect exemplar of the technical death metal genre had been
created. I thought a lot about the music on a meta-level, but I wasn't able to lose myself
in the moment and love the songs for what they were. Still, I think anyone who likes
metal should give this album a listen, and if I were another technical metal band I would
be terrified of having to live up to this. *Bleed the Future* is the exemplar of the form.
