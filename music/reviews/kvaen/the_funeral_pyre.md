Nothing like shrieking black metal to get us through these troubling times.

The mood here is a roiling tumult of noise, but _The Funeral Pyre_ is at its best when a single
voice or guitar picks out a clear, unifying melody. See around 3:00 in "The Funeral Pyre," or again
at 4:20 with the crystalline guitar. The best track, "Septem Peccata Mortalia," gives the vocalist a
lot of space to be charismatic, and I think it really works. The driving pace is exhilarating.

Some of the tracks adopt a "heavier" tone, and I don't think that is as effective. Maybe it's the
production value? It sounds muddy and undifferentiated. The first half of the "The Wolves Throne,"
for example, is difficult for me to pay attention to.

If you like black metal with a dash of lo-fi punk, this could be a great fit for you.
