Nothing like shrieking black metal to get us through these troubling times.

The mood here is a roiling tumult of noise, but *The Funeral Pyre* is at its best when a single voice or guitar picks
out a clear, unifying melody. See around 3:00 in "The Funeral Pyre," or again at 4:20 with the
crystalline guitar. The best track, "Septem Peccata Mortalia," gives the vocalist a lot of space to be
charismatic, and I think it really works. The driving pace is exhilarating.

Some of the tracks adopt a "heavier" tone, and I don't think that is as effective. Maybe it's the production
value? It sounds muddy and undifferentiated. The first half of the "The Wolves Throne," for example, is difficult
for me to pay attention to.

If you like black metal with a dash of lo-fi punk, this could be a great fit for you.
