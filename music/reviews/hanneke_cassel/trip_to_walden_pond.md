Great fiddle music.

Nothing experimental about this one, and I don't have too much to say other than
the execution is very good. As someone who played the violin for many years, I wish
that my control of the bow had been this precise. She accelerates it to create these
moments of tension and release. A few of the tracks reminded me of the *Braid*
soundtrack, which I loved.

I was impressed to discover that Hanneke had composed everything and that these songs weren't
crusty classics. They sound timeless, in a good way.
