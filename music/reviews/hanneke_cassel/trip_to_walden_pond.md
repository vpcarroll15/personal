Great fiddle music.

Nothing experimental about this one, and I don't have too much to say other than the execution is
very good. As someone who played the violin for many years, I wish that my control of the bow had
been this precise. She accelerates it to create these moments of tension and release. A few of the
tracks reminded me of the _Braid_ soundtrack, which I loved.

I was impressed to discover that Hanneke had composed everything and that these songs weren't crusty
classics. They sound timeless, in a good way.
