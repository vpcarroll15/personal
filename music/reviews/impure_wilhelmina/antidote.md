Repeated listens of this album over several months haven't helped me to figure out
whether this album is great or boring. The truth must be somewhere in the middle.

*Antidote* has the attention to detail that I expect from very good albums. There
are lots of details that feel polished and musically smart. "Dismantling" has great
syncopation that livens a simple melody, and the climax
works well for me. "Midlife Hollow" is a slamming track with a great opening hook; I've
listened to it dozens of times. Sometimes Impure Wilhelmina get noisy in an expert,
precise way that I liked.

Maybe the problem in this album is a lack of hooks? I get the atmosphere,
I get the polish, and even the lyrics are compelling; but not
many of the tracks stick in my brain. I don't feel a drive to listen to any of them,
I struggle a bit to tell them apart, and the music doesn't alter my mood.
In a way, it's the opposite of *Tales of Othertime*: polished, clever, but not
sufficiently daring.
