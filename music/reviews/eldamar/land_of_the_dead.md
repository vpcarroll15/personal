I like all of Eldamar's music, but this fifteen minute EP hits it out of the park for me.

Eldamar is the project of one man in Askim, Norway. He's a big fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, elves, and screaming vocals.
In interviews, he seems satisfyingly broody.

When I first started listening to it, there were a couple aspects of Eldamar's music that I found off-putting.
First of all, his insistence that his music creates a "Tolkien-like atmosphere." The name "Eldamar" is taken from
the _Lord of the Rings_, apparently...big kudos to you if you know which part. I don't like the idea of a musician
basing his work on a book. This is almost certainly because I'm a snob, but...I dunno, doesn't that seem gimmicky to
anyone else?

Second, nearly all of his tracks start with a long
fade-in and end with a long fade-out. I HATE it when musicians do this--it saps the momentum from an album and robs
the excitement of the track transition. Some of my favorite albums--I'm thinking _World Eater_ by Blanck Mass--have
masterful track transitions. Eldamar doesn't attempt them.

Eldamar's songs also have a certain sameness. All of them are
in 4/4 time. The set of instruments never changes. The tempo doesn't change much. If you like lyrics, too bad, there
aren't any. At least, none that I can understand.

But in the last couple months, Eldamar has won me over, and _Land of the Dead_ is the preeminent example why. Let me
talk about the vocals first. _Land of the Dead_ contrasts a growly, screamy male voice with an ethereal
female one. Neither of the voices sounds particularly human. In fact, the female voice isn't human--
it's computer generated. This contrast between the monstrous male voice and the angelic female one creates a surreal,
mythological mood. It reminds me of _Beauty and the Beast_.

Eldamar pulls a similar trick in his instrumentation. The bass is growly--a rumbling wall of discontented sound.
The treble instruments (the piano and the computer-generated flute) sound triumphant and pure. They remind me of the
biblical verse: "though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." Or the part of
_Lord of the Rings_ where Frodo and Sam have to carry the ring through Mordor. This is certainly the reference that
Eldamar is trying to make. The album cover has a the Tolkien reference: "In Mordor where the shadows are."

To me, Eldamar's work is a great example of how computers can help us to create extraordinary art. To some, I'm sure
that the computer-generated female voice would be an abomination. But the way that the voice perfectly bends itself
to each note enables a powerful artistic mood that would not have been possible otherwise.

Strongly recommended. If you like "Land of the Dead," try "Return of the Darkness," "Another Journey Begins," or really
anything from either of his other albums. The nice thing about finding an artist who makes a lot of similar-sounding
music is that if you like one track, you will probably like them all.
