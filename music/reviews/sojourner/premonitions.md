This band makes such melodramatic, silly music, but I kinda love it?

Echoey piano, haunting flute, dramatic lyrics. A track like "Talas" is so earnest that it could
be part of the *Titanic* soundtrack. It's campy, overambitious, and not tight at all.

Still, I like the music. "The Apocalyptic Theater" does the unsubtle but still enjoyable trick
where a male vocalist growls as the accompaniment to a woman singing prettily. The guitars
occasionally lay down some cool heavy melodies. And I don't find myself getting bored.

Sojourner has actually produced a few albums like this one, so if you like *Premonitions,* check
out the others. My favorite track of theirs is still "Aeons of Valor" from *Empires
of Ash,* which is so silly but completely works for me.
