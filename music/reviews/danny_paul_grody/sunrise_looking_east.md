This is a lovely piece of music that perfectly captures a moment. I actually think that the title is
essential to understanding it and liking it: "Sunrise Looking East." As we listen to this piece of drone music, I think
that we're supposed to imagine ourselves sitting in a kitchen in the early morning, drinking a cup of coffee and
watching the sun rise. As it turns out, I'm not totally making this up--here's a quote from Danny Paul Grody's
Bandcamp: "When I became a father earlier this year, my orientation to time (among other things) has changed profoundly.
One of the unexpected joys in this shift is waking up early enough to appreciate the transition from night to day...
This piece is my attempt at capturing the experience."

The music has essentially two layers: a drone and some guitar. The drone is warm and relaxing. It bends in
long arcs. The guitar will play a little phrase, or repeat a note several times, and then stay quiet for a while.

I don't know, there really isn't that much to say about this, and I don't think that it is a masterpiece, but it does
evoke the feeling of waking up very well. It succeeds richly in its narrow domain. If you're looking for something
calm, this might be a good fit.
