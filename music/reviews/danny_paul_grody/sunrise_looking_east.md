This is a lovely piece of music that perfectly captures a moment. I actually think that the title is
essential to understanding it and liking it: "Sunrise Looking East." As we listen to this piece of
drone music, I think that we're supposed to imagine ourselves sitting in a kitchen in the early
morning, drinking a cup of coffee and watching the sun rise. As it turns out, I'm not totally making
this up--here's a quote from Danny Paul Grody's Bandcamp: "When I became a father earlier this year,
my orientation to time (among other things) has changed profoundly. One of the unexpected joys in
this shift is waking up early enough to appreciate the transition from night to day... This piece is
my attempt at capturing the experience."

The music has essentially two layers: a drone and some guitar. The drone is warm and relaxing. It
bends in long arcs. The guitar will play a little phrase, or repeat a note several times, and then
stay quiet for a while.

I don't know, there really isn't that much to say about this, and I don't think that it is a
masterpiece, but it does evoke the feeling of waking up very well. It succeeds richly in its narrow
domain. If you're looking for something calm, this might be a good fit.
