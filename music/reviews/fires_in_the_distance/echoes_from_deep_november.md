Atmospheric, doomy death metal.

I think I just like this band. Not as compelling as the sequel,
[_Air Not Meant For Us_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/181), but the sound is mature and
polished. The little flares of electronica, the plodding heavy guitars. Even the spoken word stuff
is working for me, though maybe I have just gotten used to it.

Prefer the sequel if you haven't listened to that, since it has better flow and melodies, but this
is good too.
