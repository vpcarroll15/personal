Atmospheric, doomy death metal.

I think I just like this band. Not as compelling as the sequel,
[*Air Not Meant For Us*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/181),
but the sound is mature and polished. The little flares of
electronica, the plodding heavy guitars. Even the spoken word stuff
is working for me, though maybe I have just gotten used to it.

Prefer the sequel if you haven't listened to that, since it
has better flow and melodies, but this is good too.
