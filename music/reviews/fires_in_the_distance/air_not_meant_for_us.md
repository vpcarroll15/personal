Atmospheric, patient death metal with lots of lovely details.

I've listened to this album many times over a month, and different tracks appeal to me
at different times. Right now I've loving the rolling scales and arpeggios on the closer,
"Idiopathic Despair." It's a meditiation on death, atheism, depression, and the struggle to
find meaning. Somehow it's uplifting? Don't ask me to explain.

Online I see a few people classifying this album as doom. That doesn't seem right to me but
I see how they got there. It has the walking pace of doom albums--no pushing the
pace, no highly technical explosions. There's syncopation, but always 
at slow time signatures.

I considered giving this album a 3. I don't think it's brilliant--there weren't many moments
that made me suck in my breath. But the effect of listening to an hour of this thing, at its
methodical pace, makes an impression. It's quaking with emotion, and that emotion is deeply
expressed. And I keep coming back to it.
