A lot of music these days consists of a Scandanavian man shrieking about beautiful things that have
been lost, companioned by some moody atmospherics. Sometimes one of these albums captures my
attention. _Between Land And Sky_ fits into category nicely.

This album is uneven and feels amateurish, but that's part of the charm, I think, if you like this
kind of thing? There are moments of punky rawness that never crop up in albums from veteran bands.
The beginning of "The Ardent Passage" is disarmingly direct. I love it when bands abandon tedious
intros and get straight to the hooks.

Every track in this album is too long. (Except for the first track, which is an intro that shouldn't
have been included at all.) But they all also have moments of real brilliance. I already mentioned
the stirring opening to "The Ardent Passage." Another example are the stirring Celtic sounds at 2:40
in "Those Who Are Long Gone."

Overall, this is definitely an album that you can pass on, but if you like this sort of thing, it's
solid.
