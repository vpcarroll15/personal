A lot of music these days consists of a Scandanavian man shrieking about beautiful things that have been lost,
companioned by some moody atmospherics. Sometimes one of these albums captures my attention. *Between Land
And Sky* fits into category nicely.

This album is uneven and feels amateurish, but that's part of the charm, I think, if you like this kind
of thing? There are moments of punky rawness that never crop up in albums from veteran bands. The beginning
of "The Ardent Passage" is disarmingly direct. I love it when bands abandon tedious intros and get
straight to the hooks.

Every track in this album is too long. (Except for the first track, which is an intro that shouldn't
have been included at all.) But they all also have moments of real brilliance. I already mentioned the
stirring opening to "The Ardent Passage." Another example are the stirring Celtic sounds at 2:40 in
"Those Who Are Long Gone."

Overall, this is definitely an album that you can pass on, but if you like this sort of thing, it's
solid.
