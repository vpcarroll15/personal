Interesting blend of post-rock and heavy rock and metal--and yet the genre that comes to mind,
when I think of how to describe this, is jazz.

It's not jazz--please don't misunderstand me. But good jazz is distinguished by its smoothness
and flow, and this album has that in spades. It also has intricate jazzy drumwork that stands
out in the metal genre.

Some metal music is brutal or chilly or atmospheric. *Absolution* feels lush and forested, like a
landscape that we can walk through. This is mostly an achievement of the guitars and the drums.
Listen to the first minute of "Wilderness Walk" to understand what I'm talking about. This is
inviting music, by metal standards. Yes, there's a harsh singing voice, but the voice offers
few memorable moments on the album. The instruments are the heart, and the instruments are warm.

My foremost criticism of the album is that I wish it felt like it had more urgency. Sometimes it sounds
too much like some guys jamming out on a stage...not the kind of taut performance that I expect from
my favorite albums. I think it could have been cut down somewhat. On a related note, I wish the vocals
had more power, and that the album's smoothness were more often snapped or toyed with.

Still, there is plenty to enjoy here, and this is easy to recommend.
