Interesting blend of post-rock and heavy rock and metal--and yet the genre that comes to mind, when
I think of how to describe this, is jazz.

It's not jazz--please don't misunderstand me. But good jazz is distinguished by its smoothness and
flow, and this album has that in spades. It also has intricate jazzy drumwork that stands out in the
metal genre.

Some metal music is brutal or chilly or atmospheric. _Absolution_ feels lush and forested, like a
landscape that we can walk through. This is mostly an achievement of the guitars and the drums.
Listen to the first minute of "Wilderness Walk" to understand what I'm talking about. This is
inviting music, by metal standards. Yes, there's a harsh singing voice, but the voice offers few
memorable moments on the album. The instruments are the heart, and the instruments are warm.

My foremost criticism of the album is that I wish it felt like it had more urgency. Sometimes it
sounds too much like some guys jamming out on a stage...not the kind of taut performance that I
expect from my favorite albums. I think it could have been cut down somewhat. On a related note, I
wish the vocals had more power, and that the album's smoothness were more often snapped or toyed
with.

Still, there is plenty to enjoy here, and this is easy to recommend.
