This band is totally in control of their sound. It feels comforting to listen to music
like this, made with such intention and polish.

Compared to other melodic death metal, the vocals aren't particularly important here. My favorite
parts of the album are the long instrumental sections, in which the band unspools ideas
in a way that seems original and intuitive. "Med Svipur a Lofti" is a wonderful example.
At the 2:00 mark, we have the "wandering guitar," which evolves into a
"hard rock guitar." The end of the track is moody and atmospheric. Mispyrming
has a talent for creating ambient soundscapes that allow the album to decompress.

There are lots of tracks to applaud here. "Island, Steingelda Krummaskud" is so triumphant
that I think that it should have been kept as the closer. The
shorter and simpler tracks also pack a punch. The instrumentals don't do much on
"Og Er Haustid Lidur Undir Lok," but the vocals on that track might be the most memorable
on the album.

Speaking of vocals, these didn't make much of an impression on me, which I think
kept this album out of my upper echelon. I also would've appreciated
more of a variety in moods. Mispyrming alternates between beautiful ecstasy and beautiful
despair...one more mood would've clinched it for me!

Still, this is an easy album to recommend.
