I've been reviewing a lot of metal recently, and I was feeling a pull to go back to ambient music for a little while
and find some good stuff in that sphere. Almost immediately, I was fortunate enough to find something that I really
liked.

*Ecstatic Computation* is a beautiful album with dancing, efflorescent synth. Precise syncopations and restless
arpeggios give the album a wonderful sense of drive. A lot of ambient music feels sleepy, so it's great
to hear an album that celebrates the joy of purpose, the pleasure of being focused. This is what it feels like
to be wide awake and coruscating with thought.

A lot of "mathy" music feels cold, and I think that's a fair criticism of some of the tracks. The first half of
"Bow of Perception" is so austere that I don't see how anyone can enjoy it. The choral harmonies on "Arrows of
Time" remind me so strongly of Tim Hecker and *Love Streams* that I would refuse to believe that it wasn't inspired
by his work. Unlike *Love Streams,* however, which alternates masterfully between tension and release, there is little
tension or release here, just atmosphere, which doesn't sustain my interest.

That having been said...the good tracks are really good. Tracks 1-3 and Track 5 are superb. Track 2 ("Spine of
Desire") is perhaps the most interesting to me: just 90 seconds of complex rhythm. Try marking the beats on this
track: it's really hard! But despite this, the track has a melody that is memorable and captivating. Track 5 is the
friendliest track and reminds me of some of Steve Hauschildt's best work.

Also, it wouldn't be an ambient album if it didn't come with an absurd description on Bandcamp: "Computation is
turned from being a formal, automatic writing technique into a creative, psychedelic practice to generate temporal
hallucinations." I hope that Caterina is as embarrassed by this as I am.

Definitely worth a listen!
