A strong successor to *Ecstatic Computation*--probably even a little better? If you like
dancing, arpeggiated, spacey synth, you have to listen to this. Caterina finds ways
to make it interesting.

Compared to her last album, fewer of the tracks feel like half-formed ideas. She's getting
better at extending ideas and flourishes into complete tracks that take the listener on
a journey.
