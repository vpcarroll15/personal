Let’s get it out of the way--yes, the vocalist is not great. I would love it if Will Wiesenfeld
sounded like Caribou. But he doesn’t, so we’re just going to have to deal with it. At least he
doesn’t sing on every track.

If you don’t mind the voice, this is a remarkably friendly and engaging electronic album. The first
two tracks, “Knapsack” and “Swiss Bicycle,” are whimsical gems. If you don’t mind the cuteness, you
should find them delightful. The final track, “Maglev,” is a tour de force: not cute at all, instead
a perilously catchy dance number, with swooning violins and a crisp beat.
