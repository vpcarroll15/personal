Big, technical, sprawling, progressive, epic power metal.

This album doesn't play to my taste, because I tend to like tighter, cleaner
stuff, but much of it simply demands respect. If you like more sprawling metal music,
this should be a rare treat.

Take a track like "Eidolon." It opens with some orchestral flourishes, then sinks
into some heavy guitars. Then a pure male voice--the lead singer is fortunately
quite good--introduces the theme of the track: coming to terms with one's imminent death.
At around the five-minute mark, we get some spooky Halloween orchestrations, and
finally the death-metal voice makes an appearance. This is superbly well-done and
extremely fun. Then there's a downbeat, jazzy instrumental section--then
a build back to a manic guitar solo--then, finally, a return to the chorus, sung in
sort of a triumphant way.

This album is all over the place, just barely held together by relentless energy. What makes
it work is that many of the riffs and refrains that it tosses out are
so memorable. The little details, though overwhelming and chaotic, often caught my
attention. The first minute of "Visions of Awakening"--big chunks of the opening track "Dusk"--
the weird sultriness of "Spectrum." These all caught my attention and made me think that
I had stumbled across something special.

Ultimately, the perfect album for me would have more structure, more discipline, and less
schizophrenic energy. But I recognize this as a matter of taste, and for someone with
different sensibilities, I think that *In Forgotten Sleep* would be a masterpiece.
