I have been listening to a lot of frenetic music lately--music that tries to demand my
attention--and when I return from that to Agalloch, I feel a sense of relief. Agalloch isn't in a
rush to get anywhere. Agalloch doesn't want to slap me in the face and force me to pay attention.
This music trusts that it can earn my attention by unfolding at a natural pace.

In the four years between [_The Mantle_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/142) and _Ashes
Against the Grain_, Agalloch made a shift from folk to art rock. The folk influences are still here:
Agalloch's muse is nature and our place within it. But the music has a cleanness and tightness that
feels new. My favorite track, "Falling Snow," is built around some precise guitar work that would
have felt out of place on _The Mantle_. Previously, it felt like Agalloch might have been recording
in a field; now they just sing about fields.

I think that this transition suits the band well. _Ashes Against the Grain_ feels like a more
musically mature, sophisticated work. I would have considered giving it an even higher score, but
the ending didn't work for me. The last track in particular, in which Agalloch tries their hand at
atonal ambient music, is a mystifying miscalculation. Despite its rawness, _The Mantle_ felt like a
complete album: it fit together nicely end-to-end and created a compelling mood. _Ashes Against the
Grain_ doesn't fit together quite as well; I find myself attracted to individual tracks, but not
quite the album as a whole. So I think it's appropriate that both works end up with the same score.
