I have been listening to a lot of frenetic music lately--music that tries to demand my
attention--and when I return from that to Agalloch, I feel a sense of relief. Agalloch isn't in a
rush to get anywhere. Agalloch doesn't want to slap me in the face and force me to pay attention.
This music trusts that it can earn my attention by unfolding at a natural pace.

In the four years between [*The Mantle*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/142) and *Ashes Against the Grain*,
Agalloch made a shift from folk to art rock. The folk influences are still here: Agalloch's
muse is nature and our place within it. But the music has a cleanness and tightness that feels new.
My favorite track, "Falling Snow," is built around some precise guitar work that would have felt out
of place on *The Mantle*. Previously, it felt like Agalloch might have been recording in a field; now
they just sing about fields.

I think that this transition suits the band well. *Ashes Against the Grain* feels like a more musically
mature, sophisticated work. I would have considered giving it an even higher score, but the ending
didn't work for me. The last track in particular, in which Agalloch tries their hand at atonal
ambient music, is a mystifying miscalculation. Despite its rawness, *The Mantle* felt like a complete
album: it fit together nicely end-to-end and created a compelling mood. *Ashes Against the Grain* doesn't
fit together quite as well; I find myself attracted to individual tracks, but not quite the album as
a whole. So I think it's appropriate that both works end up with the same score.
