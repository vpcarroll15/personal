This is an odd one. Is this metal at all? Or is it the soundtrack for a
musical that doesn't exist?

The album opens with some a capella singing from the chorus. Then the main vocalist
enters, and she happens to have a voice that wouldn't sound out of place on
Broadway. The orchestra launches the overture: some violins, harpsichord, and a guitar.
Finally, the vocalist introduces the theme of the musical that
doesn't exist: estrangement and searching for connection in the modern world.

It's all so weird, and it gets weirder in the next track, "Break the Ice,"
which could be dropped without alteration into a musical. I can even imagine how it would be
choreographed on stage. Just read the lyrics: "In a corner street I am standing on my own \
Time just froze around me and the city turned to stone \ Strangers pass me by as I
am falling to the ground \ Wondering will I be found?" This kind of rhyming and imagery
fits on stage.

I found myself wondering: is this metal at all? There are tracks with
growling, so I suppose it must be. "Over" can't be anything but metal with its
opening shriek. Still, this album helped me to realize that there isn't always a big
gap between progressive metal and more traditional ballads.

Is the album good? Parts of it are a total jam. Everything through "Concrete Cages"
is excellent, and I loved the addition of the hurdy-gurdy.
By the end of the album, though, some of the band's weaknesses have become
apparent. For an album that is so lyrically driven, the lyrics should be better. I like
the manic energy of "Huts," but the message of that track is so stupid:
"Wish we could live in wooden huts \ The last alternative before my heart's door shuts."
It doesn't feel like a deep or thought-provoking critique of our modern world,
because really, no one wants to go live in a hut. The band repeats the same cliched
imagery across tracks, insisting that we are caged birds.

The metal tracks, ironically, are the least convincing to me. The hardcore act on "Over"
feels labored.

This is not one of my favorite albums, but it's one of the most memorable that I have
heard in a while, and I would recommend it to anyone.
