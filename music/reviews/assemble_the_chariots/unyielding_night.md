This album is silly, but it leans into its silliness so hard that I enjoyed it. The self-serious
intro in the movie narrator voice, the made-up name of a fantasy country (Aquilegia?), and then the
unrelenting intensity. I'm not sure it's good, but I wanted to make a note of it so that I can find
it again someday.

If you listen to this, make sure to check out "Last Line of Defense." When I realized that it was an
extended made-up quote from a mythic warrior, I started laughing at work.
