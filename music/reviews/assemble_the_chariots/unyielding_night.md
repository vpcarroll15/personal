This album is silly, but it leans into its silliness so hard that I
enjoyed it. The self-serious intro in the movie narrator voice, the
made-up name of a fantasy country (Aquilegia?), and then the unrelenting
intensity. I'm not sure it's good, but I wanted to make a note of it so that
I can find it again someday.

If you listen to this, make sure to check out "Last Line of Defense."
When I realized that it was an extended made-up quote
from a mythic warrior, I started laughing at work.
