Some cool tracks on here that snap from ambient to high intensity
rocking. "Conditional" has a compelling mix of soundscapes and ideas for a
three-minute track. The guitars do lots of good work, providing structure
and melody on tracks like "A Truth Worth Lying For." The vocalist is more of an
ornament.

Nothing especially original maybe, nothing leaping out at me, just
generally high-quality.
