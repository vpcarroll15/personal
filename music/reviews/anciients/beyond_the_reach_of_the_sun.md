Can't give a higher score because no specific tracks stood out to me,
but I liked this album. Smooth metal with lots of clean vocals. Nice
progressive metal touches. I found myself wishing that it were
more extreme or riskier in some way...weirder rhythms, melodies,
something. As it is, it falls out of my head too fast.
