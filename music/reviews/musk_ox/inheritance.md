Every year I stumble across a neoclassical/folk album that captures my imagination. It can be hard to predict which album that will be, because a lot of music in this genre is pretty, elegant, but dull. On first listen, I knew that *Inheritance* had broken the mold.

Musk Ox consists of three instruments: violin, classical guitar, and cello. This is chamber music mostly unaltered by digital effects. There are no electronic beats or atmospherics, and the style is clean. It could have been composed and performed a hundred years ago.

Listening to this, I was reminded of when I used to play in chamber quartets. Although I disliked playing in orchestras, which felt impersonal, I enjoyed quartets because the members directed and coordinated themselves. Part of what makes this album enjoyable is that the coordination between the trio members is extremely tight. The pleasure created by the best track, “Inheritance, Pt. 2 (Hindsight),” is that it ticks like a clock--the members play in union, split off in different directions and then join again. It’s polished and controlled, and the listener takes pleasure in the artistry. A less talented trio playing this music would produce an album not worth listening to.

Not every track gripped me as thoroughly as “Inheritance, Pt. 2 (Hindsight),” but the album is nevertheless pleasant throughout. I would recommend to anyone who likes modern classical music, or who wants music to listen to while working.
