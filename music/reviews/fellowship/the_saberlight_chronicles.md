Power metal.

Has a lovely, wholesome, friendly energy. Delightful to listen to, as it takes the listener on
a heroic journey.

The key is the vocalist: when he is given the chance the belt it out, the album shines. My
favorite track is "Hearts Upon the Hill," almost entirely because of what it allows the vocalist
to do in the chorus.

The rest of the band has a subtler influence on the album, and I'm giving the album a 2, not a 3,
because it didn't make much of an impression on me. But the framing of the vocals is
artful, and on some tracks it shines. "Oak and Ash" has more complicated instrumental sections and
I think it pays off.

A great album from beginning to end.
