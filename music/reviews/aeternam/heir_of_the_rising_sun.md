A melodic death metal album with great flow. Not many
standout singles, but it works excellently as a whole.

When I say "flow," I mean that *Aeternam* has control of its
rhythms. Tension is created and resolved at the right moments. When
a track starts to get boring, it modulates into something else. "Where the River
Bends" is a great example.

My favorite track, "The Treacherous Hunt," is one of the most
straightforward. Perhaps it doesn't need to modulate as much because the main
melody is so epic. I love the way the vocalist says "the treacherous huuuuunt"--
great execution of the death metal vocals.

I have to admit, I liked the medieval/Constantinople theming too. It has one spoken word
track that isn't too cringey, and the vocal samples are fun.
