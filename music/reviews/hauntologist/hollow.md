The band name is dreadful, and the album actually doesn't do much for me either, but "Deathdreamer"
is a superb track: a structured rolling beat, great organic sound, and a good build to the
conclusion.

The rest of the album is just ok. There are superb moments, but the quiet atmospheric parts don't do
much for me. They feel formless: no tension.
