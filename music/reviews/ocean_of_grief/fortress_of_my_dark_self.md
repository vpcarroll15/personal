Gloomy, depressive doom. Great atmosphere. It seems like it would be easy to create an atmosphere
like this but most bands can't seem to do it while producing interesting music.

There were lots of details that I liked. The odd counterbalance between the guitars and the growl at
around 1:40 on "Drowned in Nostalgia," and then more odd counterbalance on the second half of "House
of Misery." The production value is a bit low, which makes sense for a first EP. It didn't bother me
much though.
