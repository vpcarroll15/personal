Gloomy, depressive doom. Great atmosphere. It seems like it would be easy
to create an atmosphere like this but most bands can't seem to do it while
producing interesting music.

There were lots of details that I liked. The odd counterbalance
between the guitars and the growl at around 1:40 on "Drowned in Nostalgia,"
and then more odd counterbalance on the second half of "House of Misery."
The production value is a bit low, which makes sense for a first EP.
It didn't bother me much though.
