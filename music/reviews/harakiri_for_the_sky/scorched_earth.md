I thought that I didn't like this band anymore, but I think I actually
do. It's this blend of metal and emo with a little folk, super
angsty, and although I feel a little silly listening to it...yeah, I think
it's good.

My favorite track is probably "Heal Me." The guitars do some interesting stuff,
and the track passes through a couple different atmospheres, which keeps it
engaging. "Without You I'm Just a Sad Song" leans more heavily into an emo vibe.
I like the muted background vocals for the chorus.

The album is definitely too long, like all Harakiri for the Sky albums. It would
benefit from being trimmed down. Still, glad that I tried it.
