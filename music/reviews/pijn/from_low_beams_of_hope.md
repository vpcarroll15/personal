Mostly instrumental post-metal/post-rock.

I love the first track. It reminds me of some kind of depressed/fatalistic
Explosions in the Sky. I usually dislike spoken-word stuff but the Scottish
voice sounds musical and haunting.

The rest of the album didn't captivate me as much, though I do like the
opening to "On the Far Side of Morning." I think that I was looking for more
melody, or syncopation, or something to hold my interest.
