This band is totally in control of their sound. It feels comforting to listen to music like this,
made with such intention and polish.

Compared to other melodic death metal, the vocals aren't particularly important here. My favorite
parts of the album are the long instrumental sections, in which the band unspools ideas in a way
that seems original and intuitive. "Med Svipur a Lofti" is a wonderful example. At the 2:00 mark, we
have the "wandering guitar," which evolves into a "hard rock guitar." The end of the track is moody
and atmospheric. Mispyrming has a talent for creating ambient soundscapes that allow the album to
decompress.

There are lots of tracks to applaud here. "Island, Steingelda Krummaskud" is so triumphant that I
think that it should have been kept as the closer. The shorter and simpler tracks also pack a punch.
The instrumentals don't do much on "Og Er Haustid Lidur Undir Lok," but the vocals on that track
might be the most memorable on the album.

Speaking of vocals, these didn't make much of an impression on me, which I think kept this album out
of my upper echelon. I also would've appreciated more of a variety in moods. Mispyrming alternates
between beautiful ecstasy and beautiful despair...one more mood would've clinched it for me!

Still, this is an easy album to recommend.
