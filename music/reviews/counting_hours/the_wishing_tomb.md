Metal/rock with great flow.

Music like this sounds effortless to create, but it must not be because I can't find much of it.
Simple melodies, languid pace, with energy provided by creative rhythms and syncopation. Slightly
doomy, but also with purer, "normal" vocals. It doesn't feel like it comes from another planet, as
some doom does. Human, not hardcore.

The first half of the album is superb; the second, not quite as memorable.
