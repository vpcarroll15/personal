Perhaps not quite as good as the 2023 album, but still with some cracking stuff. The second half of
the album especially works for me.

I think in [_The Wishing Tomb_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/197) they do some edgier stuff
with rhythm and trimmed down some of the cheesiness and excessive atmosphere. But this is still
really good. Somewhere between a 1 and a 2 for me.
