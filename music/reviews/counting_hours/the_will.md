Perhaps not quite as good as the 2023 album, but still with some cracking
stuff. The second half of the album especially works for me.

I think in [*The Wishing Tomb*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/197)
they do some edgier stuff with rhythm and trimmed down some of the cheesiness
and excessive atmosphere. But this is still really good. Somewhere between
a 1 and a 2 for me.
