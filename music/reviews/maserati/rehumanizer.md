First of all, that album cover. Definitely my favorite of the year. Maserati is an old band, formed in 2000 in Athens, Georgia. They have been quite prolific but I hadn’t heard of them until their latest album arrived at KZSU.

This was the hardest album for me to rank. Based on musical quality, it probably doesn’t belong on this list at all; based on how much I enjoyed listening to it, it could be a bit higher. This album--as you might be able to guess from the cover, or from the band name--is way over the top. The entire thirty-nine minutes is spent transitioning from one climax to another. Listening to it in one sitting is exhausting.

Fortunately, it’s also an incredible ride. It reminds me of a space opera. Earnest synths, earnest guitar, earnest drums. It’s decidedly uncool, not restrained at all, and has the momentum of a comet.

This album also has a very expressive guitar, which becomes the protagonist of the story which the band is writing. The first track, “No Cave,” opens with three minutes of intensifying synth, like a prelude to an opera, before the guitar makes its appearance. For the rest of the track, even though a lot is going on, the guitar is the focus of our attention.

The album has its bad moments, too. I always skip “Montes Jura,” and the build-up in “Rehumanizer I” is excessive, even though it pays off in “Rehumanizer II.” Listening to this while I a climbed a mountain in Montana, though, was a hell of a lot of fun.

Best songs: “No Cave,” “Living Cell”
