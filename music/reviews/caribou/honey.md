Can't believe I've written a review for a Caribou album before! I love his work.

This isn't my favorite of his albums. Outside of the first and the last track,
I'm not clicking with much. But those tracks are terrific, with a warm
but propulsive energy. The extreme girlishness of "Broke My Heart," then the
inspiring if vague "Got To Change." Good stuff!

What can I say about the tracks in the middle though? Many of them feel more like
fragments than anything fully developed. "Over Now" is pretty cool, though
a bit thin. I feel like some of these tracks need a countermelody to cut across
them. They get a bit stuck on one idea.
