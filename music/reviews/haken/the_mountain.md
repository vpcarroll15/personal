I decided to go back and listen to some of Haken's older music. This album appears to be their
most popular, from 2013. My expectations were not so high... It's hard to make great music over
a period of ten years, and I knew to expect a different style. But I discovered that I like
2013-era Haken just as much as 2020's-era Haken--a great surprise!

I've noticed that bands often transition to making more complex music over time. Maybe
they get bored of the simpler stuff and want to push themselves? I'm not sure.

Haken has followed that familiar trajectory.
*Virus* is maximalist and works hard to keep your
attention. *The Mountain* has quieter moments and relies more on boy-band
harmonies. The pace is slower, and the album is long: more than an hour.

But there are some shared tricks that work equally well in both places.
Haken are the masters of syncopation.
A track like "Pareidolia" sustains itself for ten minutes on an evolving, gyrating beat. The
main vocalist has a pure, charismatic voice that reminds me of Thom Yorke. In *The Mountain,*
his voice comes to the fore, and the last track "Nobody" brilliantly showcases it while
echoing the earlier, more cluttered "Somebody."

Haken is also great at being weird, and "Cockroach King" excels in its weirdness. The sound effects
and vocal distortion are interesting, but it's the chorus that I love the most, with its
waterfalling piano and piercing emotion.

I'm glad that I looked at this band's back catalog! *The Mountain* doesn't sound dated or inferior--just
a more restrained version of the music that I love now. The restraint helps me to notice qualities in
Haken that I may have overlooked before. Strongly recommended.
