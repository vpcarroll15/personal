The band name is dreadful, and the album actually doesn't do much
for me either, but "Deathdreamer" is a superb track: a structured
rolling beat, great organic sound, and a good
build to the conclusion.

The rest of the album is just ok. There are superb moments,
but the quiet atmospheric parts don't do much for me. They feel
formless: no tension.
