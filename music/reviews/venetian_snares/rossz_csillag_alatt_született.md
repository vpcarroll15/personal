At last, music that reminds me of Aphex Twin that I actually
like. This album has two striking elements that,
combined, are really doing it for me. 

First, a strong classical influence. Venetian Snares is constantly
sampling classical music: Paganini, Stravinsky, Telemann, Elgar.
You can read the full list on Wikipedia if you're interested.
The classical music gives the album a formal, dignified
mood. 

This combines well with the second element: hard cuts and transitions.
This music isn't mushy. Its lines are dagger sharp. Sometimes highly
polished electronic music can feel sterile, but this music
is too complex and daring to risk that result. Venetian Snares cuts from
sample to sample in a frenetic way that will be familiar to anyone who
has listened to Aphex Twin, and--much like Aphex Twin--is capable of
building structures of transporting sound.

Not every track is a success. There are moments of pretentiousness,
moments that lack purpose (the entire first track, in which someone hits a few aimless
notes on a piano, is baffling to me), and moments that are too chaotic and cluttered.
But the album has a cornucopia of breathtaking highs that make it more than worth it.
Try "Hajnal," which combines classical music with smooth, jazzy high-hat work
that is a delight to listen to. Or "Szamár Madár," which assembles from an aimless
start a remarkably catchy dance track. I even love the odd beginning of
"Második Galamb," in which a woman speaks to a pigeon. (The end of that track
is less pleasant.)

Overall, a highly memorable album that I was pleased to discover.
