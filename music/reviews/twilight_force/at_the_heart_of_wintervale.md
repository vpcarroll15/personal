Silly power metal. So silly that I struggled to attach to it but I ended up listening to it
more than I would have expected.

The album's earnestness is its strength and its weakness. Hearing a man sing about how he hopes
to find a dragon kingdom so that he can be blessed by the elder dragon and live forever is
cringy but also kind of empowering? Like watching someone sing a ballad at a karaoke bar.

It falls trap to the common power-metal weakness of being overstuffed. Too much ornamentation,
too much going on in the background.
