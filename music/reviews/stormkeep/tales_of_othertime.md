High-energy, punky melodic death metal.

In theory this should be a perfect fit for me. In practice, I think it's kinda boring. The last two
tracks in particular are bad: "An Ode To Dragons" is atmospheric filler, and "Eternal Majesty
Manifest" ends with a shouted-word section that is ugly and tasteless. The fantasy theming on this
album makes everything worse; every time that a dragon or wizard is injected in there, I felt
uncomfortable. And this is the perspective of someone who has written a fantasy book.

That having been said, I wanted to put this album on the website because I think Stormkeep has
moments of musical power. The bridge of "A Journey Through Storms" is a rejuvenating break before we
plunge back into the maelstrom. I liked the construction of "The Serpent's Stone" throughout: the
frantic synth on top of the rolling drums. Stormkeep doesn't understand the power of restraint; the
quieter moments of the album are uninteresting. But the louder moments sometimes are fun to jam out
to.
