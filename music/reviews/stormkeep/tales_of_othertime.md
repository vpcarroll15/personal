High-energy, punky melodic death metal.

In theory this should be a perfect fit for me. In practice, I think it's kinda boring.
The last two tracks in particular are bad: "An Ode To Dragons" is
atmospheric filler, and "Eternal Majesty Manifest" ends with a shouted-word
section that is ugly and tasteless. The fantasy theming on this
album makes everything worse; every time that a dragon or wizard is injected
in there, I felt uncomfortable. And this is the perspective of someone who has written
a fantasy book.

That having been said, I wanted to put this album on the website because I think Stormkeep
has moments of musical power. The bridge of "A Journey Through Storms"
is a rejuvenating break before we plunge back into the maelstrom. I liked the construction
of "The Serpent's Stone" throughout: the frantic synth on top of the rolling
drums. Stormkeep doesn't understand the power of restraint; the quieter moments
of the album are uninteresting. But the louder moments sometimes are
fun to jam out to.
