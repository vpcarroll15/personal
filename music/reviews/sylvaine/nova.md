This month, I've been liking music that is adjacent to metal but mixes in nice elements from other
genres too. _Nova_ fits that to a tee. Although this is technically black metal because of the
occasional screaming, the experience of listening to it reminds me more of shoegaze. The vocals are
usually quite beautiful, the guitars are mellow and the sound doesn't have many sharp edges. Most of
the tension and interest in this album is created either by mild syncopations or piercing choral
harmonies.

I considered giving this album a 2 because it's quite beautiful and listenable all the way through,
but ultimately I decided that I didn't find it interesting enough. Sharper edges are nice sometimes!
