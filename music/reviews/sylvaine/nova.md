This month, I've been liking music that is adjacent to metal but mixes in nice
elements from other genres too. *Nova* fits that to a tee. Although this is
technically black metal because of the occasional screaming, the experience of listening
to it reminds me more of shoegaze. The vocals are usually quite beautiful, the
guitars are mellow and the sound doesn't have many sharp edges. Most of the tension and
interest in this album is created either by mild syncopations or piercing choral
harmonies.

I considered giving this album a 2 because it's quite beautiful and listenable all the way
through, but ultimately I decided that I didn't find it interesting enough. Sharper edges
are nice sometimes!
