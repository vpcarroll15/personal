First track is absolutely superb: a rock masterpiece. I love the
wailing voice, the lyrics (rare for me), the pauses, the western-
style guitar. But I just didn't find the rest of the album that
engaging. I normally like doomy or slowcore music, and this
sounds like a doomy, darker version of Low, which suggests I would
really like it. But I didn't. I wouldn't be surprised if I
came back to this album in a year and loved it, but for now,
scoring a 1.
