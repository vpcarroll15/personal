First track is absolutely superb: a rock masterpiece. I love the wailing voice, the lyrics (rare for
me), the pauses, the western-style guitar. But I just didn't find the rest of the album that
engaging. I normally like doomy or slowcore music, and this sounds like a doomy, darker version of
Low, which suggests I would really like it. But I didn't. I wouldn't be surprised if I came back to
this album in a year and loved it, but for now, scoring a 1.
