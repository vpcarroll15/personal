Looped ambient electronic music with choral female voices.

It doesn't have the depth of atmosphere or careful dissonances of Ian William
Craig's music, but it has sometimes else that surprised me: sometimes,
it's actually kind of catchy? It reminded me of downbeat electronic music. The middle
section of "In Light," for example, once the drum machine kicks in, or the entirety of
"Nod." It's one remix from being placed on a dance floor, and it might already be
suitable for playing in a coffee shop.

Ultimately, I just didn't find this music interesting enough to give it a higher rating,
but it nails its core atmosphere, and it's relaxing to listen to. I wish that it
were sharper around the edges...some dissonances or rhythmic imbalances might prick
it fully to life.
