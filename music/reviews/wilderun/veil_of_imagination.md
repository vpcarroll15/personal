Ambitious prog/metal album. Some tracks nail it for me, some don't.

I am writing about this album because of its second half. Its first half, I'm not sure that I understand, and I don't
think that I like. It begins with a long reading of a poem...never a good sign. Seriously, I just don't get this. Does
anyone like it when musicians read poetry? It's so pretentious, and I'm a guy with a high tolerance for pretension.

For me, this album begins with "Far From Where Dreams Unfurl." The main vocalist's voice is pure, like a prince in a
Disney movie. Good prog music has terrific flow...it never lingers on any one idea for too long, but
flows through variations. This does that in spades. "Scentless Core (Fading)" continues the beautiful tenor vocals
in a peaceful, airy setting. "The Tyranny of the Imagination"--the next track, and also my favorite--introduces
some terrific growling (I wish there were more on this album!). You may not like this music, but you won't be bored
by it. Almost every minute of every song introduces a new idea.

I won't dwell on this album for too long, because I don't think that I "get it." If you like prog more than I do,
though, or if you're a fan of poetry readings, you might think that this is a masterpiece.
