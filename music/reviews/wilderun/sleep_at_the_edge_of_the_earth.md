My favorite Wilderun album. The combination of folk/classical/metal really works here. The death
metal vocals on top of the ordinary vocals. The quiet moments of ballad or folk singing.

All Wilderun albums tend toward maximalism: multilayered complexity. Complex in genre,
orchestration, and theme. But the complexity is more restrained on this older album. It feels less
intellectual than last year's _Epigone,_ and that's a relief.

A common theme in metal albums is the protagonist going on a journey. Wilderun does this very well.
The pared-back "Hope and Shadow (Ash Memory Part II)" frames Evan Berry's lovely voice with simple
guitar picking. This swells into the dramatic "Bite the Wound (Ash Memory Part III)" which
introduces the "death metal" voice. "The Faintest Echo (Ash Memory Part IV)" is the triumphant
finale that fuses the natural and distorted voices, then allows the instrumentals to riff on the
themes. It feels natural, clever, dramatic.
