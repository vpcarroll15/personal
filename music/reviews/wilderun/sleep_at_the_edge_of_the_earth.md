My favorite Wilderun album. The combination of folk/classical/metal really works here. The death metal vocals
on top of the ordinary vocals. The quiet moments of ballad or folk singing.

All Wilderun albums tend toward maximalism: multilayered complexity. Complex in genre, orchestration, and
theme. But the complexity is more restrained on this older album. It feels less intellectual than last year's
*Epigone,* and that's a relief.

A common theme in metal albums is the protagonist going on a journey. Wilderun does this very well. The
pared-back "Hope and Shadow (Ash Memory Part II)" frames Evan Berry's lovely voice with simple guitar picking.
This swells into the dramatic "Bite the Wound (Ash Memory Part III)" which introduces the "death
metal" voice. "The Faintest Echo (Ash Memory Part IV)" is the triumphant finale that fuses the natural and
distorted voices, then allows the instrumentals to riff on the themes. It feels natural, clever, dramatic.
