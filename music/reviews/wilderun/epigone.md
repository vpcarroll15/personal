Kinda brilliant prog metal.

I know I didn't like the last album very much, but I'm appreciating Wilderun a bit more. It's a weird
combo of death metal, ambient, prog, and symphonic orchestra. The first time I listened to *Epigone,* I
thought, "Ugh, here we go again." Wilderun is incapable of sticking with a melody, or nailing a killer riff.
Everything is flowing, meandering, with a pretty tenor voice singing on top. Some albums grab you by
the throat and force you to listen; this one politely invites you to pay attention.

But, as I've listened to it more, I've liked it more, and I've ended up listening to this long album
ten or so times. The magic is in the details; the closer I look at the brushwork that went into
it, the more I'm impressed and delighted. It lovingly crafts a romantic, poetic world.

*Epigone*'s vocalist is at the center, which makes it not a perfect fit for me; I
prefer charismatic instrumentals to a charismatic singing. But the instrumentals are beautiful and
intricate, too, even if they're in the background.

Favorite tracks are "Passenger" and "Identifer," though the cover of "Everything In Its Right Place"
is pretty incredible, too.
