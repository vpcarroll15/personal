They've done it again. I loved [_Prokopton_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/81) a few couple
years ago, and although I wouldn't call _A Dream of Wilderness_ a step up, it seems like at least a
lateral move. Lateral is great if you're in the music stratosphere.

_A Dream of Wilderness_ is more restrained than _Prokopton_, which felt like it was aiming for hit
singles and epic moments on every track. Three years ago, I wrote: "The energy is extremely high, in
a way that reminds me of punk music or stadium metal." I would never describe _A Dream of
Wilderness_ that way. But large parts of the original review still resonate. Aephanemer is notable
for its polish and attention to detail, and for the bright joy that surges through every track. This
music seems like so much fun to make and to perform.

Three years ago, when I had listened to much less metal, I thought the vocalist had a spectacular
growl. Listening to it now, I am now confident that Marion Bascoul has one of the best voices that I
have heard in a death metal band. If you want to hear what I am talking about, it would be helpful
to try the last track--the French version of "Le Radeau de La Méduse"--since the lyrics will be
unintelligible and you can focus on the sound. (Unless you speak French, of course.) She articulates
her syllables beautifully, almost like she's rapping, filling each beat, tearing into juicy
consonants.

There is so much to like in this album. I haven't even talked about individual tracks yet. "Of
Volition" was the first track to make me realize that this album is special. I love the rich
soundscape that is built up in the first minute, I love the bridge into the chorus. As for the
chorus itself, although the lyrics don't make logical sense, they make emotional sense in context. I
adore when she spits out: "Elation or disarray / Passions are the potent forces leading us along the
way." The plosives and iambic verse in Marion's voice are irresistible.

It's not a perfect album. "Strider" is structurally uninteresting, and I don't think it should have
been five minutes. It also would have been nice to see Aephanemer push into new territory. Still, I
am overjoyed that they continue to produce music of such high quality.
