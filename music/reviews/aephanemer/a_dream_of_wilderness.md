They've done it again. I loved [*Prokopton*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/81) a
few couple years ago, and although I wouldn't call *A Dream of Wilderness* a step up, it
seems like at least a lateral move. Lateral is great if you're
in the music stratosphere.

*A Dream of Wilderness* is more restrained than *Prokopton*, which felt like it
was aiming for hit singles and epic moments on every track. Three years ago, I wrote:
"The energy is extremely high, in a way that reminds me of punk music or stadium metal." I
would never describe *A Dream of Wilderness* that way. But large parts of the original
review still resonate. Aephanemer is notable for its polish and attention to
detail, and for the bright joy that surges through every track. This music seems like
so much fun to make and to perform.

Three years ago, when I had listened to much less metal, I thought the vocalist had a
spectacular growl. Listening to it now, I am now confident that Marion Bascoul has one
of the best voices that I have heard in a death metal band. If you want to hear what I
am talking about, it would be helpful to try the last track--the French version of
"Le Radeau de La MÃ©duse"--since the lyrics will be unintelligible and you can focus
on the sound. (Unless you speak French, of course.)
She articulates her syllables beautifully, almost like she's rapping, filling each beat,
tearing into juicy consonants.

There is so much to like in this album. I haven't even talked about individual tracks yet.
"Of Volition" was the first track to make me realize that this album is special. I love
the rich soundscape that is built up in the first minute, I love the bridge into the chorus.
As for the chorus itself, although the lyrics don't make logical sense, they make
emotional sense in context. I adore when she spits out: "Elation or disarray /
Passions are the potent forces leading us along the way." The plosives and pentameter in
Marion's voice are irresistible.

It's not a perfect album. "Strider" is structurally uninteresting, and I don't think it
should have been five minutes. It also would have been nice to see Aephanemer push into
new territory. Still, I am overjoyed that they continue to produce music of such high
quality.
