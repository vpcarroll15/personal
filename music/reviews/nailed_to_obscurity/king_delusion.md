Death/doom music with some interesting melodies. Quiet, slow progressions
with beautiful countermelodies. I liked that doom and non-doom vocals were
mixed together, and the album felt peaceful to listen to. The quiet moments
in particular are good. A little more variety would have been nice, but still
I really enjoyed this.
