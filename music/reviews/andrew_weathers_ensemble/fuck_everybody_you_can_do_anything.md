A bunch of pretentious assholes get together in a condo in Oakland. They decide to make an album,
because, you know, you can’t just sit around drinking IPAs and single-origin coffee all day. They
want to make a folk album because folk is authentic but they also want to be cool so, in
post-production, they decide to auto-tune it. They slap on some incomprehensible song titles and
print it on vinyl.

Against all odds, this album is one of the best of the year. Experimental
folk/ambient/Americana/hipster bullshit. Try “Live by Golden Rule: Go Orange Be Strong” (wow I hate
these song titles so much) and wait at least until the line “I can see clear across the state.” If
you still don’t like it, then you can turn it off.
