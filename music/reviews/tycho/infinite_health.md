I loved Tycho when I was in college, so I'll always listen if there's
a new Tycho album. *Infinite Health* is standard Tycho stuff:
swirling, atmospheric, pretty, not especially challenging. Simple
beats. I don't find it as interesting as I used to, but I think that
there are a few good tracks. "Devices" is nice. I'm less
sure about "Totem," but it has a strong upbeat energy. Some of the
quiet tracks are so quiet that I'm not sure that Tycho is aspiring to
be more than background music.
