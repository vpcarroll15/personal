I loved Tycho when I was in college, so I'll always listen if there's a new Tycho album. _Infinite
Health_ is standard Tycho stuff: swirling, atmospheric, pretty, not especially challenging. Simple
beats. I don't find it as interesting as I used to, but I think that there are a few good tracks.
"Devices" is nice. I'm less sure about "Totem," but it has a strong upbeat energy. Some of the quiet
tracks are so quiet that I'm not sure that Tycho is aspiring to be more than background music.
