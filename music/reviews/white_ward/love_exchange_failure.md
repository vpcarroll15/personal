Screamy filthy black metal with some memorable use of saxophone.

When this album is at its best, it alternates between downtempo saxophone melodies--
quiet, restrained, like Tuesday night at the jazz club--and furious black
metal choruses. The contrast between these styles makes *Love Exchange Failure*
interesting to listen to. Punky black metal can get monotonous if the
anger and emotion aren't cut against something else, and the saxophone plays
that role well. It has such a smooth, urbane sound, while the screaming is so primal.

My score would be higher, but the album's execution is uneven. Many of the tracks didn't
do much for me. The experimental sound of "Shelter," for example, felt like a
slightly inept imitation of Tim Hecker.

Try the opener if this appeals to you. I liked "No Cure for Pain" too.
