One-track death metal masterpiece from 1996.

Showcases a lot of what I like about progressive metal: different
melodies contrasting with each other hold my attention. Just when
you're sinking into a rhythm, there's a tempo change or addition
of some new counterpoint. Because this is all one track, there's
terrific flow. Great pivoting between clean and doomy vocals.

I have to admit, I find the central "story" a bit silly. You can
look it up on Wikipedia if you're curious; it's just a little over the
top for me. Too many princesses and sacrifices.

I'm glad that I finally got to listen to this one.
