Melodic death metal with great flow. Nice syncopation. Holds up well on
repeat listening, but was also great on the first listen. Reminds me of Belakor in the
builds and the smoothness.

I especially liked “Astral Breath,” which has a beautiful chorus. “Army of Gaia” has
more of a marching, rigid feel, but it’s still excellent.

My one complaint: this is the fifth band that I've reviewed that starts with ae. Metal
bands have a slight originality problem.
