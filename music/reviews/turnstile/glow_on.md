I like it when an album doesn't waste my time. *Glow On* is compact: fifteen songs,
but just thirty-four minutes. It's catchy, dense, and sort of a perfect punky gem.

People keep describing this album as "hardcore," which doesn't seem apt to me. It's
definitely punk, but this is pop-punk; it's not intentionally ugly or jarring in the way
that some punk music is. The vocals sound light and innocent, even though
the vocalist is singing about some deeply serious topics like drug abuse.
He makes everything sound light and fun. On "Blackout," for example, he sings:
"Blackout in the middle of your life / Just like a blackout in the
middle of the night / You know it won't be long until the end." This sounds despairing, but
the vocalist doesn't seem to feel despair or even much sadness. The tone of the song is
exuberant and bright. This contrast between dark themes and upbeat
settings that remind me of a pure pop band is the defining feature of the album for me.

There are also some great heavy guitar hooks. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that.

This album probably deserves a 3, but I'm giving it a 2 because it didn't hit me
in the gut. I think I prefer heavier, messier stuff. Also, I think that it has
received enough praise this year.
