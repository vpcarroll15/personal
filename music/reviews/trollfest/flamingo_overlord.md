Brilliant but weird folk metal.

This is satire, I guess? The Weird Al of metal? The concept of this album, I think, is an
army of flamingos creating an autocracy...or maybe the concept is someone gathering
up friends to get drunk. It's certainly not meant to be taken seriously.

What makes it work for me, as someone who doesn't like lyric-focused or comedy albums,
is how the vocalist controls his voice. The weird nasal flamingo-overlord voice
on "The Flamingorilla" (my favorite track) is brilliant. I also loved the silly French
accent on "Twenty Miles an Hour," and the screaming--of course there's screaming, it's
still metal--has a shrieking quality that fits well.

The album is constantly making terrible decisions that somehow pan out, like the dad rap
at the end of "Twenty Miles an Hour" or the vocal inflections on "All Drinks On Me." Maybe
I've just listened to too much serious music recently but I was never bored listening
to *Flamingo Overlord* and I feel kind of attached to it now.
