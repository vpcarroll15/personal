What a magnificent beast we have before us here. An album that is both highly accomplished and technical, yet also
melodic and emotional. An album that touches on deep human anxieties ("I never knew sorrow till you asked me to follow
my heart") and celebrates irreverance ("This booze will kick your ass"). I am so glad that I found this thing, if a
couple years late.

Many of the albums that I've been recommending this year have been atmospheric and simple: one-man acts that pack an emotional
punch. *Tarot* is different because it really is quite technical. The guitar work is extremely precise and
way out of bounds for casual magicians. I often dislike technical guitar work. 
On some albums, the guitar player sounds like he is
rocking out to impress us, or to entertain himself. On *Tarot,* the virtuosic performances are ruthlessly
subjugated to the melody that is being produced. No solo drags on for too long; Aether Realm wedges
them into the gaps when the vocalist has to take a breath. The only example of self-indulgence comes on the last
track, which is nineteen minutes and could have been trimmed. But more on the last track later.

The first half of the album is higher-energy, funnier, and more exuberant; the second half
is moodier, messier, and darker.
Unsurprisingly, I liked the first half, but I really liked the second half. "Strength" is a remarkable track--a fiery
reflection on the limits of human ability. The drums and bass guitar pound a rhythm that should be too complicated
to be catchy, but somehow manages it. "The Emperor" is badass. "Temperance" is startlingly brave; on an album
that prides itself on its energy and technical excellence, it pares it all back and offers simple
choral harmonies. The epic last track--which, yes, is
too long--has the redeeming property that it gives the band space to experiment with sounds and textures.
It has some breathtaking surprises, such as the transition at the eleven-minute mark. It also has some of my favorite
lyrics on the album. "For nature is calling, my heart compelled; every branch, every leaf, has a story to tell."

This is a rare album that doesn't have a bad track. It's technical, virtuosic, and ambitious; but it's also intuitive
and emotional in a way that resonates on a first listen. It's easy to jump into and also satisfying to swim in
for a long time. Can't recommend it highly enough.
