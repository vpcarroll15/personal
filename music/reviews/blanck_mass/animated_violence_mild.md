I don't enjoy it quite as much as [*World Eater*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/58), but it's excellent. Industrial somewhat artsy dance music.

"Hush Money" is one of the best tracks that I've heard in a long time. Great
atmosphere, triumphant swells, and with an odd carnival-like bridge. "No Dice"
is a similar dancey track with a nice slow beat. The frenetic tracks like "Death
Drop" and "House vs House" are good but didn't captivate me quite as much.

I need to seek out more music like this.
