I don't enjoy it quite as much as [_World Eater_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/58), but it's
excellent. Industrial somewhat artsy dance music.

"Hush Money" is one of the best tracks that I've heard in a long time. Great atmosphere, triumphant
swells, and with an odd carnival-like bridge. "No Dice" is a similar dancey track with a nice slow
beat. The frenetic tracks like "Death Drop" and "House vs House" are good but didn't captivate me
quite as much.

I need to seek out more music like this.
