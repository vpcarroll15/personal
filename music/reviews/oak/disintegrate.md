A doomy one-track album. Thick atmosphere. Beautiful use of quiet, hush.

Oppressive in parts, so you have to be ok with that kind of thing.

Makes me think of nature: the sternly beautiful, remote, Scandinavian kind. The voice sounds like a
force of nature...thunder rolling in the distance.

It didn't surprise or astonish me enough to get a higher score, but I liked it. The forty-minute
single track doesn't feel like a gimmick to me when it's done well. Transitions are smoothly
executed. A touch more variety would have made this superb.
