A doomy one-track album. Thick atmosphere. Beautiful use of quiet, hush.

Oppressive in parts, so you have to be ok with that kind of thing.

Makes me think of nature: the sternly beautiful, remote, Scandanavian kind. The
voice sounds like a force of nature...thunder rolling in the distance.

It didn't surprise or astonish me enough to get a higher score, but I liked
it. The forty-minute single track doesn't feel like a gimmick to me when it's done
well. Transitions are smoothly executed. A touch more variety would have
made this superb.
