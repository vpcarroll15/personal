This album took me inside Tame Impala’s mind. I’m not sure I liked what I found there, but the beats
were super catchy.

In the first half, Tame Impala breaks up with his girlfriend, assuring her that it isn’t a big deal
and that she’ll get over him eventually. (See: “Eventually.”) In the second half, he chases after a
new girlfriend. Things appear promising at first, but then--”New Person, Same Old Mistakes.” A
not-always-likable but compelling protagonist with a profound understanding of rhythm, an angelic
voice, and a kick-ass bass sidekick.

Psych pop. Cheesy, chewy, funky. A milkshake too thick to fit in your straw. Try “The Moment” or
“Let it Happen” or “Eventually” or “New Person, Same Old Mistakes”--but if you only have time for
one song, I can’t resist “The Less I Know The Better.” Oh, and just a heads up--I know that Tame
Impala sounds like a big band, it’s just one guy. He records and produces everything himself. He’s
like our generation’s Mozart.
