Laid-back dance music with soft, organic beats.

I wanted to like this more than I did. It didn't interest me as much
as I would have liked... perhaps it was too laid-back and I was
waiting for tension or drama that never materialized?

Still, it feels impeccably well-done to me. All the little details are
carefully aligned, and the tracks that do have more drama and
momentum made an impression ("We Disappear," "Open Eye Signal.")

Interestingly, "Abandon Window"--the most atmospheric track--made
an impression as well. Witnessing a melody dissolve into
atmospherics is lovely.

I think others would like this more than I did.
