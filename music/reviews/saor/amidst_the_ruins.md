Black metal from Scotland with some folk crossover.

It's not quite sharp enough or rhythmic enough for me, but there are moments
of searing beauty. One thing that this album does unusually well is a bridge.
Bridges between melodies are breathtaking things; an entire album
of bridges would be my album of the year. I'm only half kidding.

Anyway, it's very pretty.
