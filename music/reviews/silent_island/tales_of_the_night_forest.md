Post-rock/post-metal instrumental beauty.

Guitar-focused instrumental albums always run the risk of being a little dull, and
*Tales of the Night Forest* has a few tracks that I didn't find so interesting.
Still, it has a couple of slammers--"Night in a Mossy Hut" creates such a nice vibe
for me, especially after the intro opens up into the main theme. I like how this
album uses empty space and doesn't rush into its pauses. It makes it peaceful to listen
to--an excellent working companion.

Check out the sequel album too, *The Curse of Coleodeia," which probably has my favorite
track of all: "King Pirate." If Silent Island tried to make groovier tracks and weren't
quite so atmospheric, I could see them becoming a favorite band of mine.
