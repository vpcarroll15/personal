Death/doom metal. Sad vibes, similar to Counting Hours but perhaps
the hooks aren't quite as compelling.

I had a difficult time choosing between a 1 and 2. The album feels
really consistent, which usually means that I should give a 2, but
the tracks are samey and there weren't too many standout moments.
In the end, I settled on a 1. Still, I love the opening track, especially
the chorus, which feels heartfelt. It also wasn't relentlessly
depressing as this genre sometimes is. The chord progression on "A
Certain End of Everything" is warm and triumphant.
