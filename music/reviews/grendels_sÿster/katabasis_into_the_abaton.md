Another weird album that I really liked. I don't know quite how to describe this. The creators all
have day jobs, which makes sense; it has the feeling of a much-loved side project. The fact that
they recorded the songs in English and German feels quirky and personal. So does the album cover.

What is the genre, even? It's kind of heavy rock, kind of folk. It feels retro and nostalgic.

I knew that I would have to review this when I listened to "Golden Key (Won't Fit)," which is a folk
song with a mesmerizing, courtly vibe. I must have listened to it ten times in a row and almost
driven myself mad.

The vocals are straightforward and oddly blunt. They remind me of a Wes Anderson movie, especially
tracks like "Night Owl's Beak." Without the vocalist, I don't think that this would work at all.

I found bits of the album samey and wouldn't describe it as wildly creative but I still think it's a
success.
