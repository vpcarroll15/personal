This album is so cool. So bleakly heavy and doomy: spare and trimmed down to its
black core.

The tracks are slow, but they're not as simple as they appear. The time signature and
rhythms shift under the listener's feet. "Atheon Anarkhon" is a
masterclass; the rhythm and the chords never resolve exactly where I expect,
but they always feel right. There's a beautiful melody, too, though the melody isn't
the focus; it just brackets the smothering atmosphere.

I feel like Endonomos is completely in control here--like my attention is drawn
to exactly where they want it to be. It's striking to listen to something this
intentional and polished. Peak Hamferd is like this, though Hamferd reminds me of
a bleak wasteland in northern Europe, and Endonomos feels a bit more like a city--
perhaps the inside of a cathedral where something horrible has happened. Hamferd
has more raw emotion, and this is mathier. But both have the same brutal, spare
chilliness.

If this doesn't sound fun to you, I get it, but I've been jamming out to it all week.
