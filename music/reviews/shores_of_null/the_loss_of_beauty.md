Nobody else sounds quite like Shores of Null...there's a stark kind of
folkiness to the metal that really works for me.

"A New Death Is Born" is a great example. The singer belting out
"far beyond your loneliness" is both empowering and bleak. He has an
attractive clean voice that contrasts nicely with the screeching.
The bridge is eerie: multiple layered voices. It strikes a great balance
between beautiful and devastatingly harsh.
