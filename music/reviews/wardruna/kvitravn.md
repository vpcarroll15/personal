Neo-folk music from Norway.

It took me a couple listens to settle into this. Tracks are never in a hurry--sometimes they open
with a nature soundscape, or the Norse equivalent of the hurdy-gurdy. Many of them sound like they
were cut out of a pagan ritual. The album inhabits its own slow-paced, atmospheric world.

But that atmosphere is terrific! So many albums try to do this, but most don't succeed. _Kvitravn_
has a distinctive, enveloping sound. Although this is not metal music--there is no growling, no
guitars--the mood reminds me of what I've found in the best doom that I have listened to. In the
title track, the droning undercurrent is irresistable.

So many good decisions were made to make that atmosphere more powerful. Whoever mixed in the nature
sounds did a lovely job; it's not over the top or overbearing. The lyrics are not in English, which
I appreciated. I hate it when bands feel like they have to sing in English when the lyrics aren't
important. Even tracks that are especially slow-paced or apparently structureless usually have
_something_--a clicking sound, for example, on "Vindavlarljod"--to give some structure and forward
momentum, so that we don't feel like we are wallowing.

Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that this album has some bangers on it:
"Viseveiding," the second half of "Skugge," and my favorite track "Munin," which I think has a
beautiful structure and shows off the vocalist's lovely voice.

Overall, no complaints about this album, and I might bump it up to a 3 if I am still listening to it
in a couple months.

EDIT: Still listening. I'm going to bump it to a 3. It's pretty great.
