Neo-folk music from Norway.

It took me a couple listens to settle into this. Tracks are never in a hurry--sometimes
they open with a nature soundscape, or the Norse equivalent of the hurdy-gurdy. Many of
them sound like they were cut out of a pagan ritual. The album inhabits its own 
slow-paced, atmospheric world.

But that atmosphere is terrific! So many albums try to do this, but most don't succeed.
*Kvitravn* has a distinctive, enveloping sound. Although this is not metal music--there
is no growling, no guitars--the mood reminds me of what I've found in the best doom that
I have listened to. In the title track, the droning undercurrent is
irresistable.

So many good decisions were made to make that atmosphere more powerful. Whoever mixed
in the nature sounds did a lovely job; it's not over the top or overbearing. The lyrics
are not in English, which I appreciated. I hate it when bands feel like they have to
sing in English when the lyrics aren't important. Even tracks that are especially
slow-paced or apparently structureless usually have *something*--a clicking sound, for
example, on "Vindavlarljod"--to give some structure and forward momentum, so that we
don't feel like we are wallowing.

Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that this album has some bangers on it:
"Viseveiding," the second half of "Skugge," and my favorite track "Munin," which I think
has a beautiful structure and shows off the vocalist's lovely voice. 

Overall, no complaints about this album, and I might bump it up to a 3 if I am still
listening to it in a couple months.

EDIT: Still listening. I'm going to bump it to a 3. It's pretty great.
