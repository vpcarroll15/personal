Christian death metal album.

The themes are Eden, the Fall, and the hope of recovery. It's a little cheesy and silly, but not as
much as I expected, and not more than is typical for the genre.

The first few songs are worth listening to. They have some nice rhythms and interesting flow, which
dissipates as the album enters its second half.
