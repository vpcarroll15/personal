I have been trying to listen to more of the classic melodic death metal albums, which
is how *Above the Weeping World* came onto my radar.

This album hails from 2006, back when Scandinavian bands like Insomnium
dominated the metal scene even more than they do now. It
doesn't feel dated at all: Agalloch, which
I also reviewed recently, felt more like a product of its time. If I had been told
that this album came out yesterday, I would have believed it.

*Above the Weeping World* reminds me of
[*Stone's Reach*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/140). There is lots of
syncopation--extended, wandering tracks with clever bridges.
*Stone's Reach* is more polished, though; *Above the Weeping World* is dirtier and
grungier. I wonder what this album would sound like if the production were sharper; I
would love to find out. Was the messiness in vogue in 2006, or was this a deliberate
choice of the band?

Despite the muddy production, the album had a few moments that blew me away. The second
half of "Drawn to Black," the opening minute of "The Killjoy" with its fascinating
build to a chorus. It's a comfortable listen all the way through, and I can certainly
see how this album charted in Finland. It's accessible but filled with nice moments.

I'm not sure that I discovered anything new or surprising here, but it's always nice
to add such a well-crafted album to my collection.
