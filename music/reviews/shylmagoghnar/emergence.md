Melodic death metal with shoegazey/punk overtones. It feels low-budget and simple, like it was
recorded in someone's basement. It's atmospheric and makes me relaxed. Not nearly as edgy as this
genre usually is. I did find it less interesting by the end, and the doomy tracks don't work at all
for me.
