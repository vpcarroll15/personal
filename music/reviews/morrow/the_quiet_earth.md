After the wild madness of *Fallow,* I had to carry on to the sequel, which completes the
three-album journey into a dystopian world.

I'm not sure that this breaks new ground for Morrow. *The Quiet Earth* has a similar structure
to *Fallow*: "Fugue Plague" is the mirror of "Hunt," for example. This album feels like a refinement
of the band's tricks--less raw and cutting, more polished. I compared the previous album to punk, but
I don't think I would do that here.

Both albums are bangers. "Totemic" is the rare thirteen-minute track that completely works. The
pared-back bridge at ~4:55 makes me emotional for reasons that I don't quite understand. The cut
away from the emotion to the screech at 5:55 completely works for me too: no sentiment
lingers for too long. "Fugue Plague" isn't as brilliant as "Hunt," which felt thrillingly
out-of-control, but it drives relentlessly forward and still works for me. "Of Sermons and Oceans
to Mend" is a suitably ambiguous closer.

I think I'll have to go back in time and review *Covenant of Teeth* now.
