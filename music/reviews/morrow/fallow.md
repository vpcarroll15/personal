This album is completely nuts.

Fair warning to curious listeners: it's brutal. If you like gentler, lighter, or more whimsical
metal, turn back. It reminds me of [*The Seer*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/91), which also
experimented with pounding the same note over and over. Or [*The Crimson Corridor*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/132), which had a similar shrieking voice and atmosphere of despair. But this is better
done.

There are so many genius moments that feel effortless, stripped down to their musical core. The vocal
duet plus drums at the end of "Auguries of Menace." The slightly tuneless string instruments. Everything
in "The Hunt."

"The Hunt" requires mention all on its own. It's rollicking, chaotic energy reminds me much more of punk
than metal. I don't think I've ever heard anything quite like this.

I also admire how nothing in this album wastes my time. It's super tight and dense--just forty-two
minutes, five tracks.

Not everyone will enjoy it, but it's special.
