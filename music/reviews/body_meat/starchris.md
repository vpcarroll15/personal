The most engaging album that I have found in a while. It's kind of experimental,
kind of R&B, deeply personal.

It's a stylized album, but the emotions in it actually do get to me?
"Crystalize" has wildly triumphant moments emerging out of a chaotic
soundscape. "High Beams" is simpler, more pared back, and deeply cool. The
album does a great job of keeping the listener slightly off-balance.
There is structure here, but it's organic and complex.

Highly recommended.
