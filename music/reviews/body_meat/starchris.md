The most engaging album that I have found in a while. It's kind of experimental, kind of R&B, deeply
personal.

It's a stylized album, but the emotions in it actually do get to me? "Crystalize" has wildly
triumphant moments emerging out of a chaotic soundscape. "High Beams" is simpler, more pared back,
and deeply cool. The album does a great job of keeping the listener slightly off-balance. There is
structure here, but it's organic and complex.

Highly recommended.
