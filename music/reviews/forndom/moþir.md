Very similar to [*Faþir*](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/109),
which I liked so much in 2020. But this time, perhaps because I've
changed or because the band is changed, it didn't make quite as much
of an impact.

The music feels more pared-back and spare this time, with some nice
touches of horn. What I loved in 2020 were the weird atmospheric tracks
that felt like a perfect meld of folk and computers. There aren't as
many tracks like that on *Moþir*. It sounds a little more acoustic,
a little slower. The comparison that came to mind is Hamferd, which
creates much more complex music in the gloomy, spare genre.

Anyway, I'm making it sound worse than it is. I liked many of the tracks,
especially "Rán," which does have that atmospheric feeling that I was
looking for. The violin is integrated really beautifully.
