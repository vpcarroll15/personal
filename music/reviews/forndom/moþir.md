Very similar to [_Faþir_](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/109), which I liked so much in 2020.
But this time, perhaps because I've changed or because the band is changed, it didn't make quite as
much of an impact.

The music feels more pared-back and spare this time, with some nice touches of horn. What I loved in
2020 were the weird atmospheric tracks that felt like a perfect meld of folk and computers. There
aren't as many tracks like that on _Moþir_. It sounds a little more acoustic, a little slower. The
comparison that came to mind is Hamferd, which creates much more complex music in the gloomy, spare
genre.

Anyway, I'm making it sound worse than it is. I liked many of the tracks, especially "Rán," which
does have that atmospheric feeling that I was looking for. The violin is integrated really
beautifully.
