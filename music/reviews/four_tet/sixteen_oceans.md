An uneven, highly imperfect album with some bright spots.

For a long time, I didn't write a review of this Four Tet album because I didn't think that it
merited a star in my highly arbitrary ranking system. I've reconsidered. Some of the tracks
("School", "Baby", "Teenage Birdsong") have the unique house/ambient vibe that I love in Four Tet's
music. Personal, danceable, relaxing, effortless.

The rest of the album is a meandering mess. I'm not sure exactly what makes it so bad... There's a
fear of making any harsh noise, I think? Anything jarring or strange? The line between relaxing and
boring is thin, and Four Tet has crossed it.

Four Tet has never been Aphex Twin; he doesn't load up on unsettling beats and prefers pleasant
psychedelic landscapes. But he's retreated too far in the direction of "chill-out" music, and some
of the tracks are so personal that they've become inscrutable. All the weird minute-long interludes
should have been cut.

Anyway, Four Tet just released another single, "Three Drums." I kinda liked it, but it shows no sign
of a retreat from this style of deeply chilled-out music, which disappoints me. I hope his next
album isn't more of the same.
