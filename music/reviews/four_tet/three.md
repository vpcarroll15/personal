This is my favorite Four Tet album in a while.

The music is still too smooth and dancey for me
when I compare it to his earlier, more jagged stuff, but
some of these beats are great. "Mango Feedback" has
an early-Four-Tet feeling to me in the beginning with its
Eastern flair, and its quieter interludes could be
taken out of an Aphex Twin album. There aren't as many
ultra-dreamy, sleepy tracks, which I'm a bit tired of.
There are a couple of ambient tracks, which I don't think
that Four Tet is very good at, but I appreciate that he isn't
playing it safe.
