This is my favorite Four Tet album in a while.

The music is still too smooth and dancey for me when I compare it to his earlier, more jagged stuff,
but some of these beats are great. "Mango Feedback" has an early-Four-Tet feeling to me in the
beginning with its Eastern flair, and its quieter interludes could be taken out of an Aphex Twin
album. There aren't as many ultra-dreamy, sleepy tracks, which I'm a bit tired of. There are a
couple of ambient tracks, which I don't think that Four Tet is very good at, but I appreciate that
he isn't playing it safe.
