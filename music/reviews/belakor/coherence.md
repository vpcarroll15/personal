Completing the trilogy of Be'lakor albums that I am going to review, now the newest one:
*Coherence*.

People have had mixed feelings about this album online, but I think that this is
because of the band's previous successes and the high standard that it has set for itself. 
Taken on its own, I thought that this was an enjoyable ride. The last three minutes of
"Locus" are slamming, and "Hidden Window" is a heavy gem. Be'lakor still has the knack
of mixing in clever syncopation or rhythms to liven up a track.

About half of the songs aren't so memorable, which is why I can't give a higher score. The
consistency that characterized Be'lakor's earlier work has faded a bit. But I
still think that this is a nice addition to their collection.
