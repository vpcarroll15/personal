A worthy successor to *Stone's Reach,* for which I gave a
[glowing review](https://paulcarroll.site/music/music/140) last month. This album feels 
similar to me, so I won't say much about it. The band's consistency is remarkable.

This album might be a touch more dramatic and less moody. More of a classic hero, less
of an antihero. I'm thinking of the throwdowns at the beginnings of tracks like
"In Parting," and I might also be detecting a difference in the way that the album was
mastered. The color palette feels brighter.

Really, all I have to say is that I am glad that this band continued to produce music
at such a high level!
