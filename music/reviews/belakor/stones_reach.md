The best melodic death metal, I think, works on two levels. It should be accessible
on first listen. The hooks on their own should put a smile on your face. But it should
also be the case that, on subsequent listens, the music remains interesting, and new
wells of complexity are discovered to appreciate. *Stone's Reach* lives up to that
high bar, which is why I am giving it a 3.

Moderate tolerance for screaminess is required, but if you're ok with that,
then *Stone's Throw* is incredibly easy to listen to. It's smooth like good decaf
coffee. Be'lakor has excellent intuition for how long to let one hook sink in before
moving on to the next one, and the transitions within tracks are seamless. *Stone's Throw*
doesn't demand your full attention: you can lean back, play some games on your phone,
and the music won't get in your way.

But, if you do give the album your attention, you will be richly rewarded. My favorite
tracks take the listener on an elaborate journey. "Sun's Delusion" wanders all over the
place, exploring variations on a badass melody, before gently coming to rest. There
is a driving percussion section, a soulful guitar section, a haunted piano section,
and plenty of opportunities for the vocalist to growl. "Held In Hollows" opens
with a intellectual puzzle: can you figure out the time signature for this
syncopated beat? 

The album is also remarkably consistent. There isn't a track that I didn't enjoy or
wouldn't recommend. The craftsmanship is praiseworthy.

Altogether, definitely one of the best albums that I will encounter this year.
