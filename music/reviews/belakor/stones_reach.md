The best melodic death metal, I think, works on two levels. It should be accessible on first listen.
The hooks on their own should put a smile on your face. But it should also be the case that, on
subsequent listens, the music remains interesting, and new wells of complexity are discovered to
appreciate. _Stone's Reach_ lives up to that high bar, which is why I am giving it a 3.

Moderate tolerance for screaminess is required, but if you're ok with that, then _Stone's Throw_ is
incredibly easy to listen to. It's smooth like good decaf coffee. Be'lakor has excellent intuition
for how long to let one hook sink in before moving on to the next one, and the transitions within
tracks are seamless. _Stone's Throw_ doesn't demand your full attention: you can lean back, play
some games on your phone, and the music won't get in your way.

But, if you do give the album your attention, you will be richly rewarded. My favorite tracks take
the listener on an elaborate journey. "Sun's Delusion" wanders all over the place, exploring
variations on a badass melody, before gently coming to rest. There is a driving percussion section,
a soulful guitar section, a haunted piano section, and plenty of opportunities for the vocalist to
growl. "Held In Hollows" opens with a intellectual puzzle: can you figure out the time signature for
this syncopated beat?

The album is also remarkably consistent. There isn't a track that I didn't enjoy or wouldn't
recommend. The craftsmanship is praiseworthy.

Altogether, definitely one of the best albums that I will encounter this year.
