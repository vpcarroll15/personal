Probably my least favorite Be'lakor album, but I've still been listening to it a lot
recently. Saying "this is the worst Be'lakor album" is like saying "this is the worst
Abraham Lincoln speech." It's still worth listening to. Great melodic, syncopated tracks.
It doesn't have as many moments that make me lose my mind a little bit, and there
are parts that feel forced or unnatural, at least compared to the complete
smoothness of their first two albums. But the creativity and range of a track like
"An Ember's Arc" is still very special. So many ideas packed into eight minutes.
