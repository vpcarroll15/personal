Good thrash metal.

Production value is kinda filthy, and the guitars have a grinding, churning quality that remind
me of punk. It's metal I guess because of the lyric content (swords and sorcery stuff)
and the growling/screeching, but I'm not sure that I would reach for this if I were in the mood
for metal: it would be like getting a sour beer when you want a normal one.

I found it a bit homogenous, and it rocks out in its narrow niche of sound.
