Good thrash metal.

Production value is kinda filthy, and the guitars have a grinding, churning quality that remind me
of punk. It's metal I guess because of the lyric content (swords and sorcery stuff) and the
growling/screeching, but I'm not sure that I would reach for this if I were in the mood for metal:
it would be like getting a sour beer when you want a normal one.

I found it a bit homogenous, and it rocks out in its narrow niche of sound.
