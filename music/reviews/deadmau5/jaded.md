I was surprised and pleased to see this get re-released with an extended mix.

Deadmau5's last ten years of material has its ups and downs. Some of it I
love and some of it I find almost unlistenable. But I still think peak
Deadmau5 was the one that was around when I was in high school. The older
tracks have a simplicity and balance...they aren't infected by dubstep yet
or guest vocalists. Jaded is one of those old tracks, and it's been
re-released with an extended mix that is terrific. It feels emotional like
Strobe and some of his other finest work. A long, brilliant build with
moments of atmosphere in which we can catch our breath.

The ambient track and the Volaris remix are just ok, but this is
worth listening to just for the extended mix.
