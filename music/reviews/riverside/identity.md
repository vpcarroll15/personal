Nice prog rhythms! I loved the progressions and the '80s flair.

I did not love the lyrics. I don't notice the lyrics when I start listening to an album... I have to
spin it a few times. In this case, gradually waking up to the lyrics was a problem because they were
so dumb.

"I went out into the street Wasn't here for a long time Everyone's divided Extreme right or extreme
left That's the only choice"

Ugh, that's brutal.

But don't pay attention to the lyrics and you'll discover some nice soundscapes.
