Nice prog rhythms! I loved the progressions and the '80s flair.

I did not love the lyrics. I don't notice the lyrics when I start listening to an album...
I have to spin it a few times. In this case, gradually waking up to the lyrics was
a problem because they were so dumb.

"I went out into the street
Wasn't here for a long time
Everyone's divided
Extreme right or extreme left
That's the only choice"

Ugh, that's brutal.

But don't pay attention to the lyrics and you'll discover some nice soundscapes.
